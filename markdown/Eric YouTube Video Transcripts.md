\# Every Revenue Team Should Use Clay.com

thank you so much I really appreciate that all right thank you all for having us today uh I am going to be speaking about a company today that I don't even work there I just love so much that I think everyone should know about it and uh with the this clay.com how many people have heard of clay.com before Okay cool so I might be preaching a little bit to the choir here but the only thing that I want you to take from my presentation today is to just try clay.com and I'm going to give you some reasons that you should be trying it but first I think every presentation should start off with why you should be list listening to me uh so I am the largest clay user on the platform I know this number means really nothing but uh the engineering team confirmed that we're the largest clay user on the platform by usage uh this is an a like the integration company that we use between our email sending and our CRM verified that we've gotten leads uh from like people have positively booked meetings for my customers with our outbound agency from open AI Apple beay jll Geico Microsoft Cisco the tons of others he couldn't even fit it into the graic um and then this is just me standing next to my little plaque that instantly. gave us that is a ascending platform that is a competitor to like sales Loft and Outreach um we they gave me a plaque because we generated 5,000 B2B sales opportunities in a year that was only for them they are my client and I generated 5,000 just for them we actually use a different platform for our sending which makes it a little bit tense sometimes and then this is our internal sheet where we generated 10,000 positive responses in uh over the past year for our our customers as well too and if you want to know how much clay expertise we have if you search how to use clay.com I know you can't see it but my YouTube video is the first one up there and then if you search clay.com tutorial it's clay.com and then it's my YouTube videos as well too so hopefully with that buy in you'll believe me that I could talk about clay.com and if you can't believe me then there's Donuts in the back and you take a break uh so what is clay.com they have on this website go to market with unique data and the ability to act on it sounds beautiful what really actually is it it's just a spreadsheet connected to a bunch of Integrations so you could do your job a lot easier right if you download information from your CRM because you need to clean up the emails you take that CSV and you got to upload it someplace else you validate those emails and then you need to find more emails because the original provider didn't have everything you take that CSV you download it you have to upload it to another place instead of all this download and upload stuff Clay is just a tool that you have all of the Integrations in one place and you set up logic so that you'd be able to run it what does this allow us to do just the normal things every person needs to do to clean up your CRM to run outbound campaigns whatever might be cleaning up names validating emails enriching for emails enriching somebody's LinkedIn profile finding LinkedIn profiles all of these things that can be done on the platform we won't have time to jump into all of them but I'll show places that we could go my bias obviously after you know you heard our intro I completely I forgot that I put in how many uh emails we send so I'm a little bit of a professional spammer for some of that that don't like it but um I definitely have a bias towards outbound email so a lot of the examples you'll see from my presentation or for outbound email but a lot of people are using it for their cold calling or if you're doing Enterprise sales to send all of the data to CRM so that the teams don't need to do the research and different things like that and so they raised uh $40 million at a $1.25 billion valuation and so then I just want to talk about what's all that hype about really what they're trying to do is they're consolidating the data market the same way that Zoom info has been there and Apollo has been there instead of trusting one data provider to get all the data they want to try to bring everything in and one thing that I like to talk about has anybody read the book flip the script by or claf so in one part of the book he talks about something he calls novelty chunking somebody was trying to sell him a refrigerator that had all these lasers and it had different cooling temperatures in one place and it had even a little heater for your fruits and vegetables in another place and there was all this crazy stuff and he said I don't want that just give me a normal refrigerator that's just a little nice than what you could get on the market and so what he called that was just plain vanilla with a Twist and that's why I like to simplify everybody sees clay and it's this big technological thing and all these things all it is is just a spreadsheet connected to other data providers and I'm going to show you some examples of what you could do with your marketing with it and so this I I apologize I didn't know we it' be a little bit small but this is just an example of all the Integrations that you can use inside of clay.com so if there's any data provider that you like they're up to over 100 Integrations at this point so if your favorite mobile number data provider is Lucia they're on the platform if it's Zoom info they're on the platform if whatever email finder you want to use it's all on the platform so they have all of the Integrations up here so whatever workflow you're putting together you could Stitch it together in one place instead of swapping in between all the other things uh and now I'm just going to give some examples of some emails that we have actually sent to people because we can scrape their data and then we use AI to normalize everything this we sent this on behalf of a uh Google reputation management company who they came to us and they said they sent 3,000 emails and they never got a single response and I said hey guys this is probably like the easiest like if if this email doesn't work just do not hire us because this is just like this is the only thing you could say hey I had a question about that negative review I saw on Google this is blocking a little bit but the one about RG Roofing doing substandard work that wouldn't pass inspection we scraped their Google reviews to actually find a negative review up there great oh substandard carpentry work that wouldn't pass inspection so here we're scraping their their actual negative Google reviews normalizing it with AI and then putting it into the email just straight injected into the copy is this having a negative impact of people walking to your business we're helping companies like you remove reviews like this in under seven days and you only pay when we successfully remove a review and of course then we have somebody positively responding oh I'm doxing their cell phone because I don't know how to use canva um and they said can I choose the reviews that are removed I don't want all the negative removes just the unjust ones I like okay whatever what you think about that sure and then here's another example and again this is in 15 minutes I'm not going to convince you that you should all buy clay and all these things but hopefully I can uh show you that you should at least try it what's the next one uh oh maybe it's maybe cool so now this was for a newsletter Network that this email seems a little weird because you might be thinking there's no way that they actually can service these markets but they actually can because they're a newsletter network of over 300 newsletters so we could say this hey Nicole we operate America's second fastest growing newsletter Network engaging over 3 million subscribers who align pretty well with your ideal customer profile and then we put in with AI their customer profile we scrape their website we normalize all the data and then we turn it into a customer profile that looks like this every time personality traits practical solution oriented seeking efficiency age range 30 to 55 gender gender neutral income level middle income level education level some college are higher then we AI generated this part too specifically it looks like you're looking to connect with couple seeking an easier divorce process I think we can help with that are you open to learning more hope to hear back from you soon and then again we're using AI to pull case study straight off their website saw JB's feedback about how your team was responsive during a tough time uh suggest you make a hard situation a bit smoother for many people could be something to talk about in the newsletter right all of those things just condensed from their website content put straight into the email and then finally oh this was really funny this is actually an email we send for clay.com and I thought it was funny because the response we got from this is it really depends see can I get the same person that built your email Tree in my setup because uh so this email we're using this to break into Enterprise accounts and I would s like very much say this is a very long email but we're finding that this is the best thing to break into Enterprise accounts we just got like pal Alto networks to respond just today um off this email and so we're saying basically I think you're using outbound tax to grow your company I bet your team reaches out to fintech entrepreneurs business owners and Regulatory Compliance officers before they do that do they do things like analyze the competitor's offerings in open finance do you track industry regulation and craft timely relevant Outreach do you research the founder social media to engage with personal insights on those marketing changes and then we're basically saying that clay can help them do all of those things and then we'll get responses like this of people who like they're like Eric you got to go talk to this person because they want you to set it up for them and so those are some of the crazy things that we've done for people in clay.com I it's kind of a a difficult platform to learn so we do have a a document here that this is our internal guide whenever I bring on somebody new to my team we teach them how to use the the platform by using this internal guide and I think we were so nice yes we got a uh a QR code for this and so in this uh link you're going to see a QR code that goes to a document to teach you how to enrich a company for their web traffic how to enrich companies for uh who raised money how to enrich companies for uh what roles they have open and who's hiring for those roles and then also just sourcing companies who are hiring for sales people or whatever you'd like to do and then I think we also have how to find local business owners with AI uh because you can't get them on LinkedIn so we use AI to manipulate the website to see who the local business owner is and all of those not only do I teach you how to do it in this document there's literally a copy and paste you can take my clay tables and just put them into your account and you could use them straight there as well too and then if you'd like to learn any more I also have a channel that I'm too lazy to put thumbnails on and if you'd like to also see all of our tutorials on this there's a QR code for our YouTube channel as well too and so thanks for having me today thank you so much thank thank you yeah no thank you excellent I\#\# Date Posted: 2025-01-31

we have had a couple customers join growth engine X who need a Google Maps scraper so I have updated our internal Google Map scraper and I'm going to show everybody how you can use it so uh if you've never heard of clay.com you're going to need a clay.com account but everything is using our own API keys so we are not using any clay credits for this to run at all and generally to get an email address it's costing us about 0.002 per email address at this point so this is a really really affordable way to be able to scrape Google Maps so the way that this works is uh I have a Google sheet that I'll share with everyone of all the cities that are possible for you to search by in LinkedIn and that that's kind of our BAS list over here and I will give that to everybody so we have that location here and then the first thing we have is this formula so all you have to do it when for whatever you're searching for all you have to do is put in your search so put here restaurant uh plumber uh School whatever you need to look for you can look for it there and then it's going to create a formula for your Google input and then it's going to Ping your uh server dodev key over here so I can't open this up but this is all set for you because it'll show my API key all this is set up with serer dodev so you just need to go over to serper dodev and get your own API key here it's the cheapest uh Google Maps scraper I've ever heard of so that's the one that we use for sure and then we are particularly using the Google Places API and the reason we're using Google Places is I just found it to just be a little bit better accuracy and precision than Google Maps and uh yeah we're we're using specifically the Google Places API here if you wanted to replace it with the Google Maps API it would be the same exact thing yes it's the same exact thing I just looked for it I just check double checked it and so anyway what we have here is then you can run any Google Maps scrape that you want so we're doing HVAC uh contractor in Valdez cordava and then we can hit run here and then this is going to run and then we're using the right to other table function to be able to push this data from here to the next table so you'll see we have page one here page two here and page three here which also we have page one page two page three just so that we can keep control of this workbook and none of the pages are going to go over 50,000 records because we only have 3,000 here so at most you'll only get 30,000 record Recs into each one and I also was looking at the results and generally the deepest you need to go is Page Three after that Google gets kind of crazy with everything so then what happens is it pushes the data over here and then we get the category that they self-identify themselves in so that in case you have any kinds of craziness what I would do is I would make sure that all I would add a conditional formula over here that these can only run if they have the like HVAC contractor or whatever other keyword you're looking for so grocery store we wouldn't actually want that to run I don't have that conditional formula set up over here but you could improve that we have their phone number we have their position in the ranking we have the amount of ratings that they have their current rating their website their company name and then their CID if you want to get their reviews you need the CID so I kept that included here the first thing we're going to do is we're using Cent to go out to the company website and try to find the uh owner of the company and so you'll see here it's listed on her LinkedIn profile con confirming her role as owner of the business and then we also have all this data in here and then it cost us 0.001 to be able to find this person and then we're using prosio to try to find the email address of the person given this name and the uh website the other thing I built was I wanted to double sometimes when you're using cagent things get a little bit messy especially when you're using 40 mini because I wanted to keep it cheap things get a little bit messy and so I wanted to confirm that the person was actually the owner and so I made a prompt to just make sure that they're actually the owner so if it's good to go Trina is actually the owner and then oh actually I'm going to edit this real quick we should override that if we're sending to Dennis we should shouldn't say Trina and I will change that before I release this um but basically then we're using AI over here to try to put the name of the person uh for this email address and I didn't see this Edge case and I'll fix this Edge case before I release this publicly uh so then after we try to find the owner and we try to find that email address we're using prosp to find any email address we can possibly find on the website at all and then if prospo doesn't find one we're using cagent to find any email address on the website that we can find and then we're validating that with debounce uh and then we're getting the names and like I said I will fix this one uh as well too and so in order for you to use this all you have to do is you just have to make a duplicate of this uh I'm going to share this workbook as a template and so let's go through this process right now as well too so let's just duplicate this workbook and you'll just see how we use it hold on I'm going to pause and of course as soon as I paused it uh it it loaded so now all you have to do to set all of this up is I'm going to take our server API key out of these you first have to put your server API key in here then I would download the list of all of the Cities plug the list of all the cities into the location over here change your business search change out any API keys in here as well too I will make sure that I set these to not run uh automatically so that you can protect everything as a template and then add whatever enrichments on to the end of your clay workflow that you want and you're going to be all set and so I hope this is is useful we're going to be using it internally to scrape Google Maps and I hope that other people can get some value out of this I know I've released a Google map scraper in the past but this one is is set up far more for scale and comes out of the box and I hope everybody can find some value in it\#\# Date Posted:

\# How to use filters in Make.com

I wanted to put this video together very quickly to just show um how to use filters inside of make.com and so here I have my cly integration and it's connected to my Clos CRM for all of my leads and so when I have a event in calendly called growth chat that's when I'm speaking to a new lead if anybody else schedules that's just a normal event and I don't if you schedule on my normal I don't necessarily want you to become a lead inside of close so we have this interrogation going but the only reason that it moves through to close CRM is because I use this filter where I have the scheduled event name and it must contain growth because the other one I think is just called I don't even think it has an event name I think it just becomes like person name and Eric or something like that so this one though becomes growth chat and that's how I filter it out so that it only goes in there so just really quick like you should just know that these fil exist um and you know if you only want certain data passing through the workflow here's how you would do it\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Using Routers in Make.com

so this is another pretty uh common example of using things in make.com where um we are building a campaign analytics sheet for one of our customers so that we could take all of the data from Smart lead and we put it into a Google sheet and um basically what we're doing here is we're enriching for the analytics well I guess we're listing the campaigns over here and then we have a filter to actually check that it's their user ID over here and then it's like going to a Google sheet and it's searching the rows for the row numbers and then what I really want to explain is this router thing and so we have this whole workflow going over here it's not necessarily important what's going on over here what is happening though is I what I had to account for is if we added a campaign that we have never like ran through this workflow before we can't just keep updating a row we have to add a row so what we do in make.com is we use this router where um this acts as our like if then statement and so uh basically when we search the rows and a row exists that matches and the campaign name from our smart lead API call matches the campaign name in a Google sheet we update that row and so you could see that right here where it's campaign a equal to uh data name so that's basically like this one is coming from here and then this one is coming from here so it's basically does the campaign the the data in this column do any of them match the campaign name that we're searching through right here if it's a match we're just going to update this row if it is not a match and there's none then we're going to add a row and so then you see here we just have row number basic operators does not exist then it Updates this one and so uh I won't go over this whole workflow but routers are really important for creating these like if then statements for like you know if this is true then we're going to send it here if this is true we're going to send it here and and cover all of your bases so you don't have to like because it would be crazy to like remake a whole workflow just for when things didn't exist when it's just literally you just add this on over here so there you go\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Score Leads Using Clay for Best Fits

in this video we're going to talk about the very basics of lead scoring um if you're not familiar with lead scoring lead scoring is the way that you can analyze a whole lot of data and then basically give weight to what's true about the company and then um you know come up with like a score and if they are above a certain score you're going to do something with them and if they're below a certain score you might do something else the reason I don't do a whole lot of this is um for our C usually we run campaigns in Sprints and so we don't we like score them but I'm not scoring their whole Target addressable Market necessarily what I'll usually be doing is you know if we're targeting warehouses that have six locations to 15 locations and we want to find people who are importing between Mexico and the United States that I like the I don't really need a score for that I just need to find the people who are all true for that which is so that's why I don't do a whole lot of this um but if you are somebody and and that really works when I am creating a list exactly for that purpose but if you want to take your entire Market 50,000 companies and you want to score them for um you know do they have new leadership uh is the company growing do they raise money um and like a bunch of other criteria that like this video is going to be really good for you and originally I was going to use this table but I think we're going to jump into into a different table so uh oh maybe not all right let's find some companies then uh no let's just go to the original table so sorry for those watching I apologize we'll just go to this table and so if you want to score your leads in clay the best way to do this they've literally made an integration called score leads in Clay is literally what it is so you can hit score lead whoops score score Row in clay sorry so it's the same thing as the lead and you can select how many scoring criteria you'll have so you can say like five right and so you can have a comparison type you can have your values to score like and this is exactly how you would set it up so values to score I'm going to put like the Technologies found and I want it to like contain HubSpot right and the score I'm going to give it is going to be like a five and if the values to score and I want to score their title and if it contains president I'm going to give it a three right and so this score row and Clay is exactly how you would get all of this done and so I'm actually going to reduce my because I don't want to drag on the video but this is how you would get it done and so this is really great like I said you've got 50,000 companies you need to know who are the best ones that you're going to reach out with you get all your criteria together are they in the right industry recent headcount did they raise money is the company growing are they hiring for people all of these things and then you wait each one so that you can decide okay if all the criteria is correct we're definitely going to reach out to them and if like three out of four of the criteria is correct it depends if they get the score that's above our line and that's why we're going to reach out to them so it's very very simple to do this you just hit save and run whoops yep and now we can just like get our scores here and see how we have like these eights these threes and you know all of this because they were presidents right and then this one is an eight because they have HubSpot here so uh somebody requested that I make this video uh it's really not that long because I I really don't think that it's it's that difficult like clay makes it really really easy to score these companies so basically this is really on you what's the criteria and then you come up with that that weighted score of what makes them more important to reach out to and then you can use clay to score your entire market so uh yeah it's actually really easy no no reason to drag the video on\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Overview of Apify

another out-of-the-box scraper that I think everyone should be aware of is this company called ay.com um they've got 1500 results uh of like 1500 scrapers that you could have access to and their customer support is actually pretty dang good and so um I always just show this to people to just because if you're trying to scrape anything this is kind of my go-to when it's something that I don't want to try to figure out or like hire somebody to build myself um so if we were to put in here like Zillow right Zillow detail scraper like we get all of these scrapers that you'd be able to to try right and we could put in like capterra and then we could try all of these right and then we can try um you know Twitter like you could put in anything and you just look at what you get here and so since there's so many it's tough to just like narrow down on one um but I think that you should just know about app ay.com since it's just so useful um as like a starting place for scraper one big one that I know people use it for is the indeed scraper and um this like you can put in job posts and then get the the results back um what I would say here is oh so like using these scrapers gets a little bit funky definitely if you have a chat PT premium account with web browsing like asking questions about the support do is like really going to help here a lot of times they'll have them filled out for you with the positions for the keyword search and like all of those other things so if it's like um you know sales development representative you can just build your search this way so like location for search Max items save only unique items blah blah blah blah blah blah all this stuff and then you literally just hit save and start and then it's as easy as this and now we'll be able to pull a list of companies who are hiring for sales development Representatives um you know you could certainly go deeper on this definitely use chat GPT with the power of web browsing in order to like really make your usage of this a lot faster because there are some that I've sat there and I've had to like really scratch my head and figure out uh how to use it um but you know this is really a fun one to be able to use and um gives you a lot of opportunities and like of things that you don't know how to scrape and now you can get scraped data from it so see like we already have all of this data being scraped and I'm pretty sure we had a cap on it so we can get even more than just these results but um yeah and then it just comes in straight in front of you so check it out poke around it's a really really great scraper for you know people who don't know how to code\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Target Companies With No Dedicated Team

one Playbook that I feel like comes up all the time is targeting companies that don't have a dedicated person in a role um to help the company so if you are an accountant and the company has no accountants on staff you could reach out to them if you are a designer and they have no designers on staff you might want to reach out to them this is a very easy Playbook to get done uh it's just you need to know kind of what you're looking at in order to get it done so I'm going to do it in clay first and then I'll show you kind of another way to do it in Apollo um but Clay is going to be the most like laser focus to get it done so you would just literally just go to headcount uh find employee headcount by job title and then we would map their LinkedIn URL and then again you're going to say like okay I want to find people who aren't using an accountant so I might say account accountant Finance controller CFO right and then we'll run this and and then we'll have this roll count and so if we get zero back that's another level of intent that we could say okay hey I know that you don't have these kinds of people on your team yeah so all these people they don't have accountants on their team and so if you want to reach out to people because they don't have accountants on their team super super easy to get this one done um the way you would do this in Apollo is a little bit different so in Apollo what we could do is we could go to the people Tab and we could go to more filters and see how we can find uh number of employees by department so we can add a department and here so like I said Clay is going to be the laser accurate one for you Apollo is going to just give you kind of like a something to shoot for so if we want to do the same thing and we want to say Finance right so we'll say zero Min zero Max and you're just kind of hoping that the employees by department is going to nail it here and then you can apply your filters and so we can just make sure that it says that oh I know my my camera is over this but I'm just telling you that Master Finance is zero and then the the top like it's less than zero as well so now we have all of these companies that have more no who have no Finance uh people in their department and so these are all the CEOs who don't have Finance people in their Department which I mean I find this kind of unbelievable that they have 150 employees so this is the perfect one for us to check out so we'll check this one out 150 employees and they have no uh Finance people so let's hit people and let's do a search Finance one employee what the heck freelancer interesting that's not what we searched interesting okay uh accounting accounting Information Systems accountant at 31 agency see so Apollo is going to directionally get you there but it's not going to be perfect perfect so that's why we use clay for this kind of stuff because they have the the data Integrations right here um when you're using this Outreach Again Clay is going to be the most laser accurate but clay only has access to uh public profiles so if they have a private profile on their team who's the accountant which oftentimes I I would assume would happen just say that like you did some research quickly and you couldn't find a dedicated person handling the finances on the team if you get it wrong you know like ju just try to hedge and say you did your research quickly um but this is going to get you more directionally accurate than using other tools\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Recently Raised Companies Data Tools

hey everyone the most requested workflow that companies come to us with is they usually want to Target companies that uh have recently raised money and so I'm going to go over a couple of ways to use tools you might have at your disposal in order to get this workflow done uh so the first thing is you when you're looking for companies that raise money essentially you're looking for account data not person data and so uh not every tool has person data sometimes they're just account databases they're not really person databases so what I would recommend is anywhere that you find your fundraising information take that list of domains bring it into Apollo and then go to company and then hit include exclude list of companies and drop your domains into there makes it super easy to get this workflow done so if you want to Target the CEOs of the company you just take the domains of all the raised companies and then you move it into here if you want to find the um uh Chief marketing officers the VPS of of sales or anything like this Apollo makes it super super easy to do that um you could also use clay to get this done lots of different things but I already have Apollo um pulled up and so we're just going to go over you know the different uh platforms that we usually use in order to find companies that raise money and so the first one I'll start with is just owler uh they make it really simple to find companies that raise money you can go here for your filters and then you can turn on all of your filters and then you can figure out the last fundra round like if we wanted a series B company and we wanted it to be in the last 30 days we'd be able to do that and then we can hit save and then it's going to generate for us a list of companies that let's see once it loads it's going to generate a list of companies that have raised money in the last 30 days whenever this loads uh harmonic is another platform that you could do this on I guess I just have to sign in real quick and so harmonic can get you this data as well you would just go to the custom filters hit add filter hit financing and then you can hit last funding type and we can say series B just the same and then we would say last funding date and we can just pull off you know oh well we did the other one in the last 30 days so let's do it right here great and so you will see disparities between platforms which is why you always want to use multiple data providers series B 1016 2023 one result oh yeah in the past month yeah that's probably true no companies found all right so we're going to open this up as well we'll say like the last year so let's do the same thing over here and we can do like uh 2022 November hit this and then we can see our results so we have 47 results that of companies that raised a series B and then over here we have 1.4k okay yeah harmonic has really really great fundraising information that's why I like to use it another one that you can use is crunch base and you can see I'm still on a free trial over here because we just don't really use crunch base that often to be completely honest but it a lot of it still works the same you'd have your basic info here and then funding last funding type and then we could just put series B and then the same thing funding last funding date a year ago they normalize the thing there 1471 so let's see 47 an ier 1,400 on a harmonic crunch basis 1400 as well looks like harmonic and crunch base are doing really really well with that you could also use Apollo as well when you're doing this so you could hit funding and then you can put uh last funding date in amount so you can't can't really H well no you can do series B so it would be like series B and then last funding date let's put it a year ago and then to today and then we won't put anything in for the amount so then these were all people let's go to companies so then Apollo has 884 companies that raised a series B October 16th to today and so basically now whenever you want to Target these companies what we would just do is we would just on a regular occurring braas basis we would just pull the websites from here in harmonic and then plug them into your Apollo workflow over here or you could use clay when you're building this list as well and then you could set it up whoops where you would take a CSV import and you would upload the CSV and then I'm just going to start from a blank \[Music\] table and then once you use the CSV import you could have like the website column here right and so we can just put no we don't want that we can just put a URL and then we can just put like website and we could just you know put salesforce.com and then you can have an automation for for find contacts at compan map in the website look for Vice President of Sales and then you'd be able to run this and now you'd be able to get your entire workflow going on clay.com with with finding all of these people and so this I guess would just conclude like the really easy uh way of getting this done I do want to show a complete workflow so that you could get this completely done automatically for yourself uh but at this point you can you know bounce if this was enough for you but now I'm going to go deeper into how we would actually use clay and a data source like harmonic of how we would actually set all of this up and that's going to be in the next video.\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Automatically Pause Smartlead Campaigns for Holidays

hey everyone this is a make.com scenario you can use uh this is set up specifically so that you can shut off your campaigns any time a holiday comes up for smart lead. but the principles apply no matter what tool you're using so I'm going to walk through uh how you can use this and how to get it set up and then I'll talk about uh how it all works so basically if you were to just create a Google sheet where all you had was the campaign name the campaign ID and the status that's all need to set up in a Google sheet and then if you just take your smart lead API key and you put it right here and then you take your smart lead API key and you put it right here this whole flow is going to work for you completely automatically and so for those of you that just want to know how to use it you're done go get your API key and set up a Google sheet technically you could run this whole thing without a Google sheet I just like having a record so you could actually delete the Google Sheets and you would be fine but so this is how the whole flow works so if you're interested in that you can we can do that so this uses smart leads a uh API in order to list all of the campaigns that you have in smart lead so we have something like 425 campaigns when I just ran this right now and so uh we need to get a list of all the campaigns because we need the campaign ID in order to shut off the campaign so we have that going this gives everything back in what's called an array and so all 425 just came back in an array and if you try to push that to Google Sheets you're only going to get one row added through Google Sheets so that's why you have this iterator here and so the iterator uh takes the array and separates all of it out this is a filter to filter all of your campaigns for active so the uh API like the only campaigns that are going to get act uh put onto the Google sheet and paused are ones that are currently active right now this is so that you don't have to worry about you know there's that campaign that your client told you to pause two weeks ago and then on Monday you're accidentally going to reactivate it because you know it was paused and now you're going to activate it that's not going to happen because this filter right here will only allow things to go through if it's active and then uh you're going to go through to this API call right here this API call pauses it and then this just adds whoops this just adds a uh a confirmation that it's actually paused and um yeah so you'd be able to you know pause all of your campaigns and everything if you're watching this on YouTube the uh Json export for this is going to be in the description if you're watching this anywhere else I gave it to you have a Happy Thanksgiving and use this for your campaigns to pause them\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Validate Mobile Numbers from Multiple Providers with Clay

hey everyone we got another shared table coming your way that I think would be useful Evan Dunn over at service Bell actually asked if I could create this one day and I thought it was a fantastic idea so a lot of times when you get mobile numbers from uh data providers you have no way of actually validating them uh and so one way that you could validate them is you could actually call them or you could check multiple data providers to see if the same mobile number comes up multiple times and so that's exactly what we've done here is we've turned the waterfall enrichment inside of clay into one that just runs completely straight through and it finds all of the mobile numbers and then we use AI to figure out if any of those numbers were repeated then we'll get that repeated phone number at the end and you know that there's a high likelihood that that's actually the person's phone number now if you find this too expensive to run um you could always delete maybe the ones over here like delete dagma and delete celligent and then you'd have you know these providers over over here so if you were to do this uh entire flow maybe it costs about 30 cents per mobile number but if you take off the most expensive ones right so this one's 15 all right so that's 15 cents that's like five cents that's 20 cents and then these are pretty cheap so it like if you keep contact out then you're talking about you know basically like 20 cents for an enrichment but if you are over here you're talking about like only 7 8 cents per mobile number and you're checking three data providers for it so there's lots of options and if you don't care about spending the money you could rip through all of them over here and so then you could then you get this uh number over here and all you have to do is just add a LinkedIn profile and I'm going to delete this all you have to do is add a LinkedIn profile right here and it's all going to work see how this is my this is actually my phone number don't you nerds start calling me but anyway I think this would be useful and I'll share this table with everyone\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

in this video we're going to go over uh one of my favorite things to be able to use inside of clay and that's the ability to create custom Google searches and then run them for every website or every search that you want to be able to do inside of clay and so like I said in the previous videos Google has built the world's greatest scraper for you you just need to be able to harness it and so the way you harness it is with um Google search operators and so what a Google search operator is is it's a way to manipulate a Google search so that you only get the results that you are that you want right and so if you were to type in um uh like unemployment law right you're going to get a ton of blog articles about unemployment law and you're going to get like ridiculous stuff it's going to be really really messy but if you say hey on this website do they mention unemployment law on this particular website you can use Google to get a yes or no on all of those and so this blog is one that I'll be linking to um I wrote this whole thing with actually maybe mishy helped me I kind of forget but um yeah I wrote this blog to go over all of the different Google searches and some ideas of ways that you would use them um we're going to go over probably the most used situation that that comes for me and so we're going to jump over here and we're going to add a Google enrichment so we'll hit Google search and so here's how we open up the the Google search query and so what we want to do is we want to see do any of these websites mention I don't know let's find these companies privacy policy right and so or let's find their pricing page whatever and so you see here how we have HTTP colon backback ww. that is going to mess up your Google your Google search operator search so there's two ways that we would be able to get a what's called a bare domain one is we could separate the um domain from the email address and that's kind of your bare domain but that's not going to be the best way because we don't have an email address for everybody so we're going to clean up this uh domain for us here so we're just going to bounce out of this and we're just going to say normalize a URL and we're going to say normalize a domain actually and we're going to click on website and we're just going to click bear so you use this normalized domain uh integration in order to take all of these websites and go from HTTP colon ww like dot blah blah blah and then it's just going to turn into just boom apple.com so we're just going to pick Bear right here continue to add Fields we'll map the normalized URL and now we get all of these cleaned up for us so now we're able to do a Google Search and so really quickly this the same way that you would do a Google search in the browser is the same way you're going to use the integration so if you read the Google search operator blog there there's one called site whoops I guess there's a lot called site this is my favorite operator because if you want to know does this site mention these keywords which oftentimes us as salespeople when we're researching websites essentially what we're doing is we're researching to see if they say something on their website we can jump in here and we can just say site colon and then we would map the the normalized URL so it's just site bbw.com just like right that like that now we're going to try to find their pricing page so pricing you usually people put pricing I just want to show something to you what we want to do is we want to do a bullan search here which um I don't think I'm going to go over in this course just like ask chat GPT what a Boolean search is everyone should know what a Boolean search is you spell it b o o l EA n um just look it up everyone should be able to do it so what we want to do is we want to find pricing um or like any other things that might make them have their pricing page so when we put quotes around a word that means that that word needs to be on there there can't be any synonyms so if we didn't put um if we didn't put quotes we could put pricing and then it might find like price and it like might go crazy so when we put quotes around it we're like we only want this keyword to be returned but now if we want to check for multiple keyword so if we did like pricing and we wanted to check for um money I guess I don't know or payment let's do payment if we did it like this it would kind of mess up our search because it it now see I don't really care if it finds pricing and I don't care if it finds payment I just want it to find one or the other so what we can do is we can put um parenthesis around it and then we could put a big O which this is the basics of bullan searches so basically it's saying if you find pricing great if you find payment okay but like I just want one of them and in this way we could run this search and it'll either find pricing or it'll find payment and it'll just bring it back to us if we wanted to find a page that mentioned pricing and there had to be a dollar sign on the page so we actually wanted to find that and both of these had to exist we would put pricing and dollar sign and then do our search like this so for now we'll just we'll just do pricing we'll get rid of the the parenthesis and we'll hit run and we'll just see can we find these companies pricing pages so we perform this search and so anyway this is like a really basic way to use Google search so we have this and we can hit the Google search results good upfront pricing to avoid any surprising great so it's it's this link that they hosted on and so like I said when we as salespeople are doing research a lot of the times we're checking their website to see if they mention something and the Google search um integration can do that research for you all in one shot as long as you know how to structure your URLs correctly so definitely give this blog article a read so that you'd be able to um to use that so yeah uh that's Google search operators very very basically read this read this blog\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Sync HubSpot and Smartlead Automatically

this video I'm actually going to try a new format where I'm going to go through the explanation right now and then afterwards I'm going to plug in a video where I actually built everything so that we can keep it super high level you can finish the video and learn everything that you want and then you can move on to the boring part where I don't talk and I just build everything so the first steps in order to create your HubSpot sync is you need to set up the web hooks to get you all the information from Smart lead so in this situation we need to know every time an email is sent anytime an email was responded to and then we need to update the lead category once we get there so sometimes clients want to know when emails uh were opened we didn't do that here uh it would be all the same steps but you just add a third I mean a fourth web hook so all you have to do is go to smart lead and go on their web hook views over here and you would be able to set up the uh updates and for some reason this looks like it was incorrect which I don't know why it would do that since it sent it already so we just put this in I don't know why it's saying invalid URL that was odd anyway so we have the email sent email response and the category update you could just get those when you add the web hook and then you have the event right here we're sending all those to a clay table we always hit test web hook first before we add it so that we can get everything in here and then we have all the data done super super simply in here so then we mapped the event type the email the two name the subjects the text we sent the time oh one thing I guess you'll see me added in is we didn't add the reply so you could go down in here and you could hit the reply and so then we could take the text and we'll say reply text and then we'll also hit reply time right we'll put that in so now this can get synced as well and then all that happens is we just need to add create or update the uh contact in HubSpot which we do right here and then we just map everything that we need I'm waiting on a couple of properties that they want filled out so we're going to finish this but say we wanted the lead status oh it's not going to be in here say like company name actually there's an interesting way we could get this too um any of this information we could just map here and we can get it done quick thing is if we wanted company name what we could add to this column is since we are always using a CL we always use a clay table even if we don't put any AI messaging into the campaign we at least are using them for the the email validation process so what we could do is we could look up a record in another table and look for the email address in that table so that we could get all of the data from the table as well so if you needed the company name and you needed whatever other information you have in that other clay table you could add a lookup record and then look up via the email address in here and then you'd be able to place all that content in HubSpot as well but so this is just the conclusion of the overview if you want to watch the really boring part where I'm not going to talk and I'm just explaining exactly what went on here keep watching the rest of the video for for talk about this when I finish it but we're just waiting for some client um input for the property Fields here and we're going to be done\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Email Validation Tools and ROI

so in this video we're going to talk about cleaning your list so we've already talked about how you Source your list how do you enrich that list and how do you clean that list and so what we're going to do here is just talk about the main email providers and how they work so basically to my understanding if anybody tells me I'm wrong I'll change the video to my understanding what these email providers are doing is they have a bunch of IP addresses that they send these kind of like test SMTP checks to the domains to check if they have an MX record they check um like a couple of factors and so basically if they do a lot of checks and say they were only to check email addresses that are valid the IP's reputation would never be hit the IP's reputation gets hit when it checks an email that's actually invalid and so then the IP reputation goes down all this is to basically say when you're testing when you're looking at email cleaning tools they all work the same way they the the process is the same nobody here on this list that I'm going to show you has reinvented the wheel on email validation the big difference is you're paying for a pool of IP addresses and even if you don't understand that I just want you to know that like you're not paying for any separate process you're just paying for like who has the cleanest IPS that you're you're validating from and so um what these tools will do is clean your list so that if you so if you ever send an email and the email is wrong you get a bounce back if you get too many bounces that's obviously going to affect your email reputation want to keep that bounce like around like we want to keep it lower than 2% but like 2 to 3% is acceptable and so um these so these tools this is exactly what they do is they try to prevent you from bouncing and these are the best tools that I found I'm going to explain my preference for all of them and so debounce is our daily email validation tool um it in my opinion has the best blend between um pricing and quality and we'll like I you'll just see that when we get into pricing right so when we look at this pricing you know it's like 10,000 verifications and it's 0.15 per verification okay great zero bounce I would say is probably the market leader as far as email validation goes it's really really really good the only problem is is that it's priced here and so when I think about these prices right so if we want to look at like 10,000 right so we want 10,000 it's $64 and they're $15 is zero bounce uh what's the difference between these is zero bounce really four times better at email verification than debounce no it's going to be marginal um and so when I think about this from an Roi perspective that's that's what I'm thinking is like yeah I'm not I like I don't use zero bounce because you know the difference between 10,000 emails here and 10,000 emails there is kind of crazy um and so if my list is super small and I need each and every one to be really really perfect if I'm like only validating a list of 5,000 I'll go to zero bounce though because then like I know that I'm getting the the best quality on the market so debounce we use kind of daily zero bounce we use um you know if it's a really really small list and we really need it to be right and then there's some app Sumo deals that you can get as well rayon rayun is really really good honestly the big reason we use debounce and not rayun is one because they allow for 2100 credits a day we just would burn through that super fast maybe I should evaluate like 4,500 credits per day but I I think we would really burn through that pretty quick I know they have this 700k life time credits maybe I should buy this I don't know but yeah um people really like this tool we just use debounce because it integrates into our workflows better um and this one does it pretty well there's another one called email list validation that is super super cheap super cheap and so instead of getting email credits daily what they do is you can buy three million credits per year five million credits per year for $295 if I wanted five million credits let's put it in here um five1 two3 oh yeah 5 million credits please contact us all right you got to talk to Enterprise um a million is going to be almost $2,000 on debounce and let's see it's $500 on debounce okay oh no this is zero bounce and then here it's 295 so it's the cheapest if you were go to email list validation i' I've had a couple problems with them in the past it wasn't that like you know it was fine um I just you know don't use it anymore debounce fits into our portfolio it's like email list validation would give us problems sometimes zero bounce is really expensive debounce is kind of that middle ground for us and so when it comes to email cleaning our our go-to is debounce but um for high quality zero bounce is it and then we'll flop between like rayun or email list validation and uh yeah so everyone you need to clean your list before you upload these are the tools that we use to clean our lists and uh yeah no secrets here this is exactly how it happens\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Use ChatGPT to Build Google Sheet App Scripts

hey everyone a lot of times I see people asking questions that you could totally have chat PT figure out for you and so I wanted to make a video where I did something that I've never done before and I made it work just using chaty PT so I have never created an App script in Google Sheets in my life to do anything and I've never done it to be able to add a lead to Smart lead so we are going to use the smart lead API to add a lead to a test campaign and I'm going to do it all with chat TBT I don't expect it to be beautiful I don't know even what's going to happen we'll have this part as the intro then I'm going to give an explanation after I did the uh work and then there's going to be a really boring part that's going to be however long showing precisely how I actually got the app script working I'm not going to talk during that part because I'm just working but the next part of the video is going to be me explaining the steps of what happened we did get this app script working we have my email here and my first name over here and here we have a test campaign where there's no leads running at all and so if I just come in here and I just hit run campaign and I just finished running the script now we refresh this and we have my first name and my email address loaded into the campaign ready to go so here's a quick overview of basically how we got it done it was much simpler than I thought I if I were to do this again I'd want to figure out how to make this a formula I didn't get too into that and I I did it so I didn't want to get too into the weeds of doing this but I'd love to make this a formula that I'd be able to just drag and drop and run through everything but so here was literally my chat gbt props I want to build a Google appscript that allows me to add an email to a campaign the email will be in A2 and the first name of the email will be in B2 this is the API we need to play with boom boom boom boom boom all this stuff and then it outputed this answer so I did all of this and I literally just copied and pasted it into the appscript over here I'm not going to open it because it has my API key for smart lead in here um I changed these things because we lost a client because this is true I don't know why they keep it as default true so just be on the lookout that that happens and uh then we just inserted it so then I didn't really know how to so it actually took two seconds like literally not even two like 30 seconds to get this part together I I just didn't know how to actually launch the function so I just asked it and uh I wasn't really sure if I needed to add a new thing here I don't know how that works this button is what I tried and that's how we got this button right here um and then the cell change I'm not even sure how that would work I suppose oh so then I even ask it I say you know how do you make this run and it told me \[Music\] um hm maybe this would work I'm not sure this actually seems more like what I would want it to to do and to run so I guess I would you know I have a question right now do I add this to the same app script deployment I don't even know if that's that's why I didn't even do this oh great so actually let me pause and see if this works trying to get this to work right now and so I went into the logs and it's saying that we don't have the permission for that so I'm just copying and pasting it in here so I guess we're going to pause and add this to our function so this isn't working the way I wanted and I'm running out of time but what I did find is that that the button works for everything so if I come here and we hit run and it finished running dang I hate these things how did it just change anyway I got to do some messing around and I'm running out of time but after after this you can see how I built it in its entirety we just going to add my API key I just did something in the app script where I deployed I just don't want to show that because I didn't want to uh show my API key huh not beautiful but we did it\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Custom Scraping Workflow with Scrapestorm.com

all right hey everyone I got a request from a client to scrape this website as I started looking at it it's like uh stealing candy from a baby at this point so I wanted to make this video to show how easy this would be so what we really want to do is we want to find um we want every broker on this site and we want to yeah that's what I thought okay we want to find every broker on the site and we want to get their email addresses and all of those things and so this isn't the search that we want so I'm going to walk through exactly how I think about this I haven't set this up yet if I make mistakes it's going to happen because I haven't seen all of this yet what I did see though is if I put ib. org locations Florida I think that's what I went to First no this is what I did so this is the link they sent me probably yeah this is the link they sent me and so if you look at this this is almost everything that we need we have their name and then we have their phone number and then when we click into this more details when we click in we get their email address all right so that's pretty dang good uh so what we could do is could just scrape Florida here with something like instant data scraper and then go back but I'm not going to do it that way we're going to use scrapestorm to get this done so what I can do is uh so this is all of Florida I noticed on another page that they oh whoops I noticed on another page that they had all of the states listed which is exactly what I want but why can't I find it okay here we go so Brokers by State this is the page that we want because what's happened here is if I hit Alabama looks like there's no pagination or anything yeah so the way we can also check if there's no pagination is if we go to California because California is going to have more business brokers than anybody else and we just look at this list yeah see how small this scroll bar is so if we keep going yeah this is everybody yeah great so that's that's everybody in here so we're going to go back to the find a business broker and we're going to start on this page so we're going to take this link and we're going to open up scrapestorm and we are just going to enter this in right here great so now it's reading everything it's going through it all it's Auto detecting things I'm going to stop that because I don't actually need it to autod detect anything wow never mind okay so I was going to map this but it autod detected everything that I wanted anyway so that's great so now what we're going to do is we're going to highlight this column and we're going to click scrape in now this is going to open it up so it's going to open up Alabama so this is great and so we're going to change this from a detail page to a list page and so we'll click Auto detect here again this is great I want that link right there I think it's this James Minter James Minter okay so this is what we want so now we're going to highlight this one we're going to hit scrape in and now this is where we're actually going to pull the data so we're going to stay on detail page we're going to click add field and we're going to put uh we're going to name this no I'm going to name this one rename rename rename this is going to be called phone number then we're going to get this one this is going to be email I guess we'll take their addresses usually when I'm here I'll just take everything because I just I want to redo this see if there's anything else we can get guess we're gonna have to do that serving Central Alabama great great great great great great okay so now again what we're doing here is we're starting from this page to get the state then we're getting this data and then we're grabbing the individual data about each person so we have three levels of scraping going on here and you can actually watch it as it goes so we're going to do this so it's going to begin and then once it runs a little bit we're going to click show page so you could see what's going on so see how it's on Winden Townley and it's collecting that information now it's on bill and it's collecting Bill's information now it's on Keith it's collecting Keith's information so what we're going to do is we're going to make sure that this paginates the next state so in Alabama there weren't that many people so we're just going to sit here and we're just going to watch to make sure that it goes to Alaska and then to Arizona in Arkansas after that but this is basically a very quick dirty setup to be able to scrape this list and get all of these custom people all of their email addresses and all that fun stuff so see how it keeps going back to that Alabama page once it's done with the Alabama page it's going to go back to the state page and then do it again great so now it's searching to see if it missed any of them it didn't now we're back on the find a business broker page yep now we went to Alaska now it's searching all of these people and it's going to grab all of them again and so now it's just a matter of time as it's going to pull all of this data and we are good to go\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

so in this video we're going to talk about email enrichment in particular and email cleanup as well and so the reason we're on better contact rocks is because this company allows you to run a workflow where you could take a person's first name last name and their domain and I'm pretty sure you could do a LinkedIn profile as well and then they try multiple data providers see all these data providers they try multiple data providers to see who has the the email address and so basically especially when the name is first name last name and domain what a lot of these providers are doing is they are validating and we'll talk about email validation um for the second half of this video what they're doing is they're validating like they're trying Eric get grth engin x.com versus eric. no slowski growthin x.com versus Eric no lowski grth enginex like everybody's email is basically the same thing right and so they're just guessing and then they're finding the one that's the most valid and then they're giving that one back to you or the first one that's valid and so um I show this platform because this is a really easy platform to like find multiple data providers but I'm also showing this because at one point all of them are basically the same and um we've done a lot of data analysis on this as well and I could tell you which ones are the best but I just wanted to show you this because this there is a platform that will combine all of these for you clay also combines all of them for you which I'm going to show in another video but I I I want this course to be as wide as possible off of this list it's basically like dagma Drop contact and find email that are going to get you the best results oh and Apollo sorry I was you know thinking about that as prospecting so find email Apollo drop contact and dagma are basically going to get you all of the results here and what's so great is like find email and dagma only charge you if they find valid email addresses so a lot of times in our workflows we just start precisely with them and so I did an email test and I'm just going to pause very quickly to pull up this email test and so I made this blog post for clay and um this is the uh these are the email enrichment providers that we tested and these are the rankings of of how it went and so basically what I did is I took a list of um emails of people who had responded to us in an email campaign and the reason I did that is because like I said a lot of these email providers are just doing this like validation thing and sometimes there's false positives or false negatives within the validation and so what the reason I ran the campaign only on people that responded back to us was because then it's like we don't have to run it through a validator like this person sent us back an email that's 100% a valid email address they emailed us back and um it also was a really good test because this campaign that we got 4,000 responses on was uh the so 4,238 responses the re the way we got that many responses is because uh it was a campaign that was difficult to say no to and it targeted HR professionals at companies with 10 employees to 10,000 employees so the market was super super big and we're sending a lot of volume the other part was there was no industry specific so I know a lot of people are always talking about like well you know company size really matters and um the industry really matters and so when we were sending it didn't matter it was any industry any company size we just let it rip and so the way it shook out was prosio took number one drop contact took number two dagma and find email tied for three and then Hunter people data labs nimbler and snav what I will say is Valentin and I have been in contact and I think the next time we run this test find email is going to be like up in this like it's going to be really contentious I'm not sure who's really going to win so I would I would put like find email back up um DET tagma pricewise it's just absolutely amazing so when you're using this the databases that we're talking about in the previous video and you're finding the email addresses from Apollo or you're finding the email addresses from seamless if you want to really maximize that list and use it more you what you can do is you can um like maximize those lists clean the list and then run them through these tools to find even more email addresses um and so now in the next video we're going to talk about how to clean lists\#\# Date Posted: 2024-05-01

\# Overview of Clay's New Workflow Feature

so clay unveiled uh workflows which I am putting together a list that workflows is perfect for and I just wanted to show you so uh basically I want to find every business broker in the New York City metropolitan area now one way that I could do this is I could pull all the titles of anybody who says they're a business broker and then pull it that way then but then I'd be missing out on all the people who are like the CEO of a business brokerage right and so workflows is actually a super fast way for us to be able to go from any company that's that business brokerage and then I can find all the right titles in the right cities because I'm not I'm going to keep this United States because maybe it's headquartered in other places but then we're going to do the location targeting and on your clay plans this is like free to be able to run this and you could just build these lists so the new workflow setting starts with the get companies from LinkedIn so we're going to do business brokerage mergers and acquisition mergers I won't do acquisition but merger and acquisition know I can't think of anything else so then we'll hit this and we're not going to limit the results then we're going to preview the companies well so there are a ton so we're going to see how far over it is 50,000 boom million I wonder if mergers is making this too crazy CU 2 million is nuts what H this is pretty crazy so we are going to reduce it to just uh New York New Jersey I always forget how to spell Connecticut I might have even SP misspelt Connecticut right there is looking good so these are looking good so now we'll just import the 50,000 we don't need to enrich anything we don't need to do any with anything with these because we're just going to look for titles after this so we're going to continue then we've got the companies and now we need to go find the people so now I want things like business broker partner founder CEO chief executive boom so now we'll pull this this location again going to be New York New Jersey and then maybe Connecticut if I can spell it right and we'll hit preview people and then we're going to let this rip as well and so see how now it's all connected together which is a lot better for our purposes great so now we'll import all this and I will do the work email waterfall I don't need to enrich their profile but we will do the work email waterfall to get this and then all of this is going to go in and now with the workflow function we've essentially put company lists and people lists together and so I don't need to draft emails I don't need to run campaigns so now I'm actually good going to jump in here and I want to see what we've got working we've got all the emails and everything oh I didn't I don't really want these to run so I'm just going to delete these so we're going to let all these run and and we will just take it from there so this will turn into a good list for ourselves as well all right and that is how you can use the new workflow feature in clay\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

everyone I'm going to make this video as it's super short and I'm waiting for another automation to load this video is how we have set up a complete inbox management system that admittedly at this point is 50% done but it will show you the gist of it where we are automating or semi-automating the lead category updates inside of smart lead across all of our campaigns and so the whole goal here is when people say stop or they say unsubscribe or they say they're not interested or they say they're out of office or they say they no longer work there those things you don't have to manually tag these things we get so many responses every day it's actually turning into a full-time person's job to manage the inbox so I wanted to take away 80% of the work that they do and anything that says out of office will just automatically tag as out of office anything that is overtly not interested will Mark as do not contact and we'll add them to our client's block list and then uh if it's overtly interested we'll also Mark it as interested from there as well and so we already have the do not contact one set up and so the first thing that you need to do in order to make this workflow work is uh we have a Google sheet with all of our campaigns that I made for a data analytics purpose that's a completely different video all I did was just look up the campaign IDs and then I added a web hook to every single campaign and we can actually set this to run you know every two days or whatever we want to do so that anytime there's a new campaign and it doesn't have a web hook we'll just add the web hook all of those web hooks point at this clay table right here where we map out the reply body here we clean up the HTML right here so you could just clean that up it's literally just use the AI formula generator and just say remove the HTML from body and then we have the campaign ID we have the client ID this actually it didn't matter we didn't need this I was just trying something and so then all you have to do is you have to look up the lead in your campaigns so that you can get the lead ID and then once you get the lead ID you can actually use the integration over here inside of clay to update the lead category so we can do another one right now so the campaign ID I'm going to map that with tokens and so that'll be the campaign ID and then the lead ID we will map normally and then the category ID now we will do out of office so now we'll set up a formula so we'll just put this and we'll put formula contains out of office or out of office or I think this is case sensitive so we'll do that too or vacation and those kinds of things right so then we'll hit generate formula this I don't trust but if we're just looking at this I trust this so let's try this all right so let's hit save and run our rows no what the heck why did it do that this formula hang on you guys don't need to watch me debug this let's just see yeah hang on I literally added an if in front of it and it worked okay so then if it includes any of those then it'll just run and it's just going to update them as out of office right and so uh some things you might want to add on top of this and man why is that taking run this back okay so anyway some things you might want to add to this is an API where me personally if somebody gets marked as do not contact I like to add them to our client's block list over here so that even if we try to reach out to these people on behalf of our clients again accidentally then it kills the whole thing and so now we can do inbox management by keyword and we'll automatically create all the web Hooks and all I have to really do from here is just add a couple more categories like I said it's not quite done but I haven't put out a video in a little while so I wanted to make a video for you all and um we're going to add a couple more categories and then I'm just going to watch and just make sure that we get good coverage on the keywords that I I think that are in there and uh you know and then we can download this manually check it do all those things and uh we'll be good to go so I hope this was useful if you want to do this in Google Sheets you could probably create your own app script for it um as well and just use the app script function and use chat TPT to figure that out maybe that's a video for the future but yeah I hope this gives some people some ideas about how to do some inbox management at scale\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Intro to Make.com

hey everyone so in the past we showed off clay.com we showed off some uh outof the-box scrapers and uh so I'm going to show you my favorite workflow Builder tool where if you want to automate things between softwares and you don't want to use code in order to do it make.com is one of my favorite um platforms to use in order to do this now quickly like people are like well why don't you use zapier and so the reason I don't use zapier is because make.com uh I have much more control over what I'm able to do between everything and they basically all have the same Integrations uh for the most part zapier has a couple of things um so I basically have more customization in make.com and then for other people who are like well why don't you use a platform like n8n um I don't use n8n nn.com like n then the number eight and then n.com if you want to look it up I don't use that platform because uh it's a little bit too customizable for me um requires a little bit too much code and like I've said in some my other videos you kind of have to have a point where you're like okay look like this is all the software that I'm going to learn after it gets to a certain point I'm going to offload it to to somebody else and make.com sometimes even gets to that point where you should probably offload this to somebody else but so um make.com though is a great place to quickly build workflows of things that say you wanted something to happen daily an automated flow to happen daily you want an automated flow to happen every time you um like an action happens or you just wanted to move data from one place to another without like manually doing it make.com does a really really great job of that and so when I first got started um in outbound and my agency I actually really couldn't find very good make.com resources and I'm not even going to try to claim that I'm about to create a really great one I'm going to try to explain the pitfalls that I fell into and we're going to go over some examples so that you can see exact how it happens and how it works so hopefully you'll be able to apply that going forward again though if you have chat GPT premium 20 bucks a month their web browsing is so good if you just prompt and you just say like how would you figure this out in make.com to connect this to that and it goes out and it'll find support docs and it'll give you the answers back so um it's gotten a lot easier since then really like use chat BT to your full advantage to get this done I am not a make.com expert I just find it to be very very helpful in my business and I want others to be able to take advantage of it as well and so we with that intro two and a half minute intro um we're going to go over like the basics of make.com and the the functionality of it and so um basically it's telling me click here because you get access to all of these different data Integrations or workflow Integrations inside of make.com it's a gigantic gigantic gigantic list and so you right here we have LinkedIn which is really really great this is all really like you don't actually want to use a lot of these you want only the compliant ones like leaked and Lead gen forms I don't even know what this one can do get follower statistics make an API call get a post create posts okay great like whatever so um you can like use some of these and then you're able to to add things in so one that I use all the time is like the calendly one and so if we were to just hit calendly right and then we'll just hit watch events so now it's going to say that it wants you to add a hook adding is super easy so this is just my Calle hook it's connected to Eric agrowth engine.com this is the connection I want to add um growth and so now we would be good oh my gosh I guess I have to sign in I'm going to bring this someplace else and so now I'm just going through a sign inflow hang on okay got that figured out and so now we have this calendar Le flow so it's watching for events so what this means is when a new event happens it's constantly watching and once that event comes it's going to come in here um this is the equivalent of what's called a web hook that uh you might want to learn about in my video about how to read API docs and the difference between web Hooks and and things like that so this is technically a web hook and then what we can do is every time a new event comes in we can do something with that and so now we'll click add another module and we're going to hit Google and so essentially oh uh Google Sheets and so now what we can do is every time a new event comes in I can add a row to a Google sheet so we won't do it for that one we'll do it for like this one and so now I'm am going to create a sheet very quickly and basically I can say like event name calendly test event name and time right and so we'll just plop that in and so now what we can do is we can say okay great so I'm going to map it to this cly oh it failed to load the data I'm going to enter this manually so the spreadsheet ID is just up here maybe not select by path what's going on here see this is even why like hold on whoa whoa click here to choose the file fail to load the data okay so I got the spreadsheet ID to be cly calendly test literally I just put in here calendly test and then we were good to go sheet name we're going to put sheet one table contains headers yes and so now what we're able to do is we're able to map the values here so if we come in I can see everything that calendly offers me that I can use so we have cancel URL created at email event name new invite blah blah blah so for event name that's going to be the actual event and then for time we're going to go into time and then we're going to hit created at because that's the the time that I want but if I don't want created at and I wanted like when is the event let's see I so if you were to actually run this and get data it is way easier to run this but so anyway let's just put Time created at um questions and answers great okay whatever so now what would happen is what we've set up is essentially now anytime a new calendly event happens it's going to add to this Google sheet and so if we were to like click run once uh well actually this isn't going to work hold on pause well and so while it was paused it ran and so then we get like test 1014 2023 gets loaded into the Google sheet it automatically adds the row if you want to check like we can run this and we could be like you know event again we can just hit test and we could say like here right you could hit okay right now you know that that's running come in here and it does that right and so um yeah now I typed this in so that's why it's different right there than what calendly gave but yeah this is what it's going to be um looking like so what we're basically going to do is for the rest of this module course kind of thing I'm going to over real live make scenarios that we have so that you can see how I've used them different things that come up how I think about putting them together and then there's going to be some that we're actually going to create uh so keep on going through this module and learn how to use make.com as as best as I can teach\#\# Date Posted: 2024-04-01

\# Verifying Companies are SaaS Companies

so this one feels like it took forever to put together but I just finished a scoring model where you would be able to import any company domain you want and we use zenr to scrape the crunch base owler and zoom info pages and then we're also going to scrape the website itself for specific keywords so Zoom info has tags saying that a company is a software company and crunch base has tags saying that they are a software company and then is just good for like extra description stuff actually we could probably even remove ower to be completely honest um from this and so um the whole goal here is if you're familiar with building lists nobody really has a great SAS list and the problem with SAS lists is because a lot of these companies they don't say they're a computer software company on LinkedIn if you're a SAS company that works in the real estate industry you're going to say you're a real estate company which makes it pretty difficult so we have compiled internally a list from from Apollo ocean and owler of a bunch of different SAS companies and we are just going to upload them and pass them through this scoring template and then we'll have a list of companies that we really really are confident are actually legitim software companies and then we can even score them by how many keywords show up so after we do all the scraping everything goes into this one keyword lookup over here including the scraping of the actual site and then we're looking for all of these different keywords I might add more over the weekend as we keep doing that and uh then we just count up how many keywords they say and so the ones with like 51 is this really uh well-being platform supports corporate and Community Health yes so this is definitely a sass they have a platform and all those other things what is this this transaction spe about items offered for exchange yep definitely ass sass Yep this is a ass cool yep SAS as well what's the website here 433 yeah y y so it's a SAS so anyway the whole goal like I said is to build a master list of all the companies that are actually SAS and then I think we'll probably release it sometime next week after we pass all of the the data through here I won't be giving this template away but we'll be open sourcing the list once it done it's done so uh hope you find this interesting and might give you some ideas of how you could score some other companies one day we're even going to score um Shopify like when you download a list of Shopify Brands you can't really you don't really know like Biden for America for instance has a Shopify technology install and so uh we're g to do this for SAS and then we're going to do it for e-commerce sometime pretty soon as well so yeah really great use case for zenr over here\#\# Date Posted: 2024-04-01

\# Bulk Google Maps Scraping in Clay with Serper.dev

hey everyone so one thing that is tough to do in clay.com is to build a really large list of local businesses from Google Map scraping just because they want you to enter some of the data first and then you have to completely rerun it and you can't programmatically run it across you know lots and lots of different locations and so I built this template here where it takes in all of the locations that uh are actually available on LinkedIn as well this is over 2,000 locations available on LinkedIn there's other ways you could do this you could ask Chad for cities and things like that too and everything and uh we actually integrated it with the serper dodev um API and it's the places API and then this is the Google Maps API so you can pick which one that you like super dodev s.dev is a super super cheap website where you can do uh Google scraping and so this is it right here ridiculously cheap Google scraping Errol toker told me about this one and it's absolutely fantastic and so then uh what you can do is you can run your Google search apis uh over here and then you'll you know pull out the results of the people and so basically what we have going on here is we have the location and then we can change this box here for what restaurant we well for what we want to search so like we have to do a search for revenue cycle management companies uh pretty soon across the United States so now this is all going to change and then uh we currently have this table pause so we don't run all of them without being completely set but we could just run it right now it would be completely set because then the Google Input is literally the area that we want and then we're looking for revenue cycle management and then we would be running our um places uh surf API here now you might be wondering what these numbers are for you need to be able to paginate the Sur uh Pages you could do it I mean again I'm not a developer if anybody calls me out they're like oh there's so much better way to do it let me know because I couldn't figure it out you could batch create these things and you could put like page one page two page three page four but then in clay it was getting too big and there was just this mess and everything and so we just did it with one and then when you create another one you create it with two and then you get different results because you're paginating through the Google Places API or the Google Maps API whichever one you want to use and then you can just write these to a table and then just uh get all the information from them and so instead of manually hitting the Google uh Maps integration in clay right here right instead of using this if you're not familiar you'd be able to just run this at scale so in kind this is kind of a short video so I'm just going to wrap it all up we have all these locations over here and I can give away all these locations if you want then in this I can give this template away too then right here you would just literally change what type of business you want to search so you could also search for like pest control companies or whatever you want to do then that changes this input and then all I have to do is just duplicate these columns and we'll get you know all of the outputs that anything works for the Google places in that location and then you'd be able to scrape Google Maps at scale so if you needed to find any of those local businesses that don't have a link presence this would be the way to do it\#\# Date Posted: 2024-04-01

\# Preview of "The GodFather" Prompt for Cold Email

hey everyone I wanted to give a preview of something that we've been working on that I like to call The Godfather prompt and the whole point of this prompt is to be able to take the insights that you would say if you were to reach out to somebody manually what would you actually say to those people and how would that change your message and we can fill out basically a form where we say you know hey given this LinkedIn profile what would you say to this person and given this LinkedIn profile what would you say to this person and then we can train an AI model and then you could write three to five messages and then scale those insights across your entire market and so basically this is the way that it works this is the first table that right now is not connected to a form but we could easily connect it to a for it takes your company name your website and all this information then we have LinkedIn Target one everything about LinkedIn Target one we have the company description that we're reaching out to and then we have an opportunity for extra research type and then ex extra research uh on LinkedIn one so we can insert hey you know they have an open right now we're doing website research which is fine but we could say hey they have an open job and specifically they uh are hiring for an SDR so we could put that in here as a manual uh input and then we did the same thing for a LinkedIn profile number two and then we did the same thing for LinkedIn profile number three what we're also doing is we we have the input here where we can manually say what is the actual email that I would send to this person so see how we have email sent to LinkedIn one so we can manually write this and say hey given this person's LinkedIn profile this is what I and what their company does this is what I would say to them and given this person's LinkedIn profile this is what I would say to them and given this person's LinkedIn profile and what their company does this is what I would say to them and then we have our templated message and then we have background information and so now we can fill all this out a form would just get filled out and then we can go to table number two and so table number two this is just an example table over here nothing crazy see how we could put new column in here and we just inserted clay.com all then we're doing is a lookup right here so now we could fill out the form and we could launch a new table and we can look up everything uh in this table so now we can have as we could have 50 different forms in this one table and then once we find then we could just say hey for this particular customer this is the one we're going to use so we would just change this column to just be clay.com or any of our other customers um domains then we would look up the record and then we could write our own messaging based off of the past context right so we have this gigantic prompt where we're inputting the background information about my company which is coming from the other table we have the templated messaging which is coming from the other table then we have the current prospects job title the current Prospect summary the current summary of the their current role the current description of what their company does and then we can insert custom research as well and we have all of these rules as well and all these other things so then what we're also doing here is I need clay to upgrade this a little bit for me what we really want to be able to do is then set as an example and we would have this prompt and then we would have an example right underneath it to say okay here's all the rules all I did though at this point was just insert it and I just said okay this is an input of an example and this is what I would say to them using this as a guideline for you know the one that you're going to be completing up here right and so then we have the LinkedIn string and we have the company description and then we have the email that we would send to them which now this is a preview because it has taken so long to get to this point I would say that now I just have to increase the the quality of the inputs at this point because I was just writing things to just get things written but you can see now that to each person we're writing completely personalized messages in the voice of what we've sent in the past we need a little bit of a clay upgrade over here and I need to improve the inputs because getting all this done by itself and prompting it was pretty tough but so then we say like I noticed that APN systems offers efficient Digital Services to various Industries do your in-house teams ever struggle with scaling Outreach due to researching every potential client detail we aided the SAS firm blah blah blah blah awesome and so then see how it's like I see you're successfully developing social stas products with over 150,000 customers so straight to the point of these people and then it's talking about how we've helped these other people as well and it's tying it in Al together again what I am not super proud of right now is the total output here uh due to the inputs not being that crazy just yet this is just a preview we're going to be improving all the inputs and then that's going to be improving the outputs over here we need clay to build a tiny feature where we can also input um columns into the example which we can't do right now but that'll be coming this is just a preview I can't wait to show you guys how it works like crazy but uh so far it's been very interesting of what we've been able to get it to say and align with some of our past messaging so um one day we'll release this as a template but for now we're going to keep working on it and I just wanted to send out an update everyone\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Local Business Prospecting Tools

hey everyone uh in this video we're going to go over the tools that I use and they're kind of my go-to tools when we are doing local business prospecting so when we're doing local business prospecting the problem you're going to run into is they do not have a good LinkedIn presence so obviously if somebody doesn't have a LinkedIn account you can't find them on sales Navigator right and so um when you want to Target plumbers HVAC restaurants H you know now I can't even Architects like these well Architects not maybe not but these people who really won't have as good of a LinkedIn uh process and that they're not going to be on LinkedIn as well sales Navigator isn't going to always work sometimes we'll start with sales Navigator just to see what we get because it's going to be the highest Fidelity information that we'll be able to capture but then there's a waterfall of other tools that I try um instead and so the uh the first tool that I of course would suggest is is Clay they have and I've got to sign in I guess um whoops so clay has a uh let's just let this sign in I guess so clay has a source where you are able to find local businesses using Google Maps um you could use that one right here then we also have D7 lead finder which D7 lead finder allows you to just put in like HVAC anywhere and just hit choose a city and then you could just you know pick like Miami and you're good to go outs scraper has like a custom Google Maps scraper that you can use and you'd be able to scrape Google Maps because the big thing to think about here is if they don't have a LinkedIn profile any plumber worth their salt any HVAC person worth reaching out to is going to have a Google Maps profile so clay D7 lead finder and then the Google Maps data scraper these all do really well to uh to scrape Google Maps and that's exactly what you want to be going for and then I just bring up Andrew eler I don't think I've ever heard his last name in my life but anyway I I just bring him up because uh he does all of my Google Map scraping and if you just want somebody to just do it for you and is done and he finds the contact information I just go to Andrew it's like so much easier than that and then uh sales Navigator like I said it will work but you just have to use your searches in a different way if you're targeting tech people like they're going to have super well figured out um sales Navigator profiles where you could use their current title and things like that what we'll do is we'll go to like the Search keywords and I I'll do bullion searches instead so I'll be like owner and and then put them in parenthesis and I'll be like garage door repair or garage \[Music\] door installation I was like what am I thinking of an installation so that when we get this list company owner garage door repair owner 80P garage door repair owner at Ohana garage doors owner Precision garage door so now we have a super high fidelity list of the people who do have LinkedIn profiles we could use that to start with and then we could use the other platforms to to get what we want um another way that you could get this done too is you could use Yellow Pages here here we'll just hit the Yellow Pages right so we'll go to Yellow Pages and what you could also do is you could say like uh yeah let's do dentists in the Bronx sure and so see how now we have all of this information in front of us this is really easy to scrape like it's almost I'm just checking my video Yeah you could see it this is really easy to scrape it's like almost too easy to be able to get this information so see on the bottom left oh my screen it actually isn't showing up in the preview on this website I can see that they have a website I'm actually linked so on my bottom left I'm previewing it and it's Riverdale Family Dental pc.com that's perfect that's exactly what I need and so what we could do is we could just use instant data Scraper on top here and then you could just look through everything that you're collecting so we've got the number we've got the business name we've got the Yellow Pages link we've got their website and then we've got their actual real website here excellent and I just keep going through I've got their phone number got if they're open or not okay cool so we'd be able to scrape Yellow Pages here as well oh let me show you like the full so then if I hate look okay next button we just hit this oh instant data scraper I'm so sorry is in a different window and I'm showing my window right now just trust me that instant data scraper is showing you what you want to be seeing right now it it it just is and then you could see how it's like automatically paginating for me um so yeah that instant data scraper would work for you as well and you could use other filters up here too now if you click on them like taller Dental let's see if they have an email address address on here just going to search yeah they didn't have an email address let's go to one of the first pages though oh no no not an ad no okay so do they have an email address they don't have an email address but they have a a Facebook link which is like that's like a whole other thing to get the email address from the Facebook link like let's see I I would honestly use an AI agent yeah see how they have the the email address right here it's probably best to like use an AI agent to get at this um maybe I'll make a video on that but that's not the the focus of today's video and so these are kind of the tools that I would use uh in the next video I'm going to show the actual workflow that we would use when we're doing our uh local business prospecting basically we'll use D7 lead finder um Andrews data or outs scraper and then we'll feed that into clay and uh I'll kind of explain why we take those databases and then feed it into clay but we're definitely using clay because the problem you need to solve for is some people have some people we can find the founder of and some people we can't and you need to change the messaging depending on on who it is uh so I'll see you in the next video\#\# Date Posted: 2024-04-01

\# Send 3 Leads For Free in Your Outbound Emails Automatically

so I've been trying to think about the craziest outbound email that you could possibly send and so one email that I thought would be crazy for us to send in the agency is to research a company see what types of companies they sell to and then what titles they sell to and then in the email give contact data in the email and say hey I found three leads I think they would be a good fit what if we hopped on a call and we found more leads for you now if this sounds a little bit familiar we have created this workflow in the past but it was not scalable it was kind of janky it was really really expensive to run and so while we would run it I would almost run it just so that we could say that we ran it but we couldn't really scale it and so this table we revamped the entire table and now we can run that so the whole goal of this campaign is to be able to reach out to somebody and say hey I was looking at your website and I saw you help people do XYZ I figure you try to sell to VPS of sales CEOs and chief Revenue officers um I did a little bit of research and I found some leads that I think would be a good fit for you if you want to hop on a call and improve these leads or I'll give you a free list of 5,000 of these leads let's chat and so this is one of the outputs from it is like we're literally going to be able to say Ash new Bane associate manager Information Technology um at OPA and then we have the email address we even are getting their mobile phone numbers too um so that in the email I can literally say this is Ash's email this is the phone number do with it what you will right I think a pretty solid uh campaign so the way we make this happen is um we basically just use AI so we have the description of the company and so we have one step where we say like hey give me IND industry information about the company and then we say so this is with GPT 3.5 to keep it cheap and then this is with GPT 4 Turbo because we need the the knowledge uh up to 2023 and so we say literally looking at this company like looking at these inputs give me a company that fits these inputs right and so then we got like a super super cheap run over here and then again we get another super super cheap run over here too and then it just outputs right fit companies for them so if you look at some of these like we'll look at like our vision is to be the operating system for Supply chains using our Aid driven process they're targeting manufacturing retail e-commerce 500 to 10,000 blah blah blah blah blah here's the companies that they'd be targeting totally makes sense to me I would agree with that right and we could go through more of these but it's fine like I guess I mean just to show pay it is the solution government agencies use to take the friction out of Resident transactions great so then we found companies that would be a good fit nyc.gov la.gov blah BL blah then we just mapped them all out into a um into the table which admittedly I guess we didn't re oh no we did need to do this because we output them as a comma separated format we could output them as a Json but I find that sometimes clay will like the AI will make it Json in one way and then it'll output it in Json in another way and it won't fill everything out so we just mapped it uh like that and then we're using find contacts at companies oh well actually I guess we're doing this first we're using AI to figure out what contacts they sell to and I'm trying to create a gigantic list of contacts so we can put that list of contacts into find contacts at companies and it runs on all five of them and then we run we write all five of them to a completely different table where in that table we're finding their email address and we're finding their mobile phone number then we filter list of objects for only people who have an email address then we create a formula here where we say okay we have this person's name and so now in the email I'm literally going to send this as a custom variable like I think you should be reaching out to this person and then we filter the list of objects again for people with an email that don't work at OCTA so that we could have a really like nice other company to say so now we could say hey I think you reach out to Scott s the software engineering manager at twilio and then we filter it again so that we can say hey I think you should reach out to Lucas the engineering manager and uh I believe its phone number is and we can just fix that a little bit I believe there phone number is I had my team finish this one off I believe their phone number is boom boom right and so I don't know about you guys I think it's a pretty killer campaign we'll give this away as a template one day I'm going to milk it for a little while before we get there but uh yeah this is a lot of fun to put together I I have dreamt about this workflow and nailing it and uh we finally did so yeah I hope this gives some ideas for some other people of some crazy outbound campaigns you can run we're going to be taking this first spin for a little while\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# How We Use Ocean.io for Account List Segmentation (FULL TUTORIAL)

again everyone thanks for watching the YouTube videos in this video I want to give a deep dive demo into a platform called ocean. that we have been using that is really really helping us build way better account lists I've made a video in the past about their lookalike audience targeting and today I'm going to do a much deeper video about the whole platform and and things that I like about the platform and things that you know maybe they could add in and things like that but anyway uh let's jump straight into the platform right now okay so this is the ocean. platform and we're going to look jump straight in and talk about their lookalike search so we've already done a video on this so if you have seen that video I apologize I'm going to repeat myself a little bit the this is probably the feature that ocean. is known for above anything else everybody comes to ocean. and they talk about how their lookalike search is so amazing and I have to admit it's freaking fantastic it's super super super super good and so we use it when we bring on a new client and one of the first campaigns that we run is we basically want to say okay who are your best types of customers that you have case studies with so we can build a lookalike list to those case studies and just go out to those people and say hey we're already doing it for this type of company we could do it for you let's go unless there's some kind of competitive advantage and they you know wouldn't want to be cross-pollinating like that it's always a good idea to be running those kinds of campaigns so what we could do is uh just build a list and so say we were just put in clay.com and then we could get a lookalike list and we could fine-tune the lookalike list by saying this is our primary company that we want to find uh lookalike audiences for and then we can add in more similar companies so it only has 57 results and all of them look pretty good drop contact Wisa discover data you know this makes sense discover data shouldn't that just be Zoom Ino anyway so these are all pretty good data companies data automation right here lead jet okay looking pretty good we can add in another and we could say Zoom info and now we're going to get a lot more hits because their algorithm is is getting a lot better with this so like Apollo being on this list infot intelligent being on this list exact buyer being on this list lead 411 great great ocean. being on this list you know they put themselves right at the top sales Intel being on this list awesome and so then we even go to the last page and we could take a look at these companies we might not know them as well but then so look we've got this is a CRM and sales automation platform CRM sales automation cool sales Pro leads right all these things so it builds amazing amazing look likee filters what you could also do is if you don't have actual company domains that you want to build lookalikes based off of you could also use their AI assistance and so I even did this before and I was looking for um mobile app marketplaces that deliver alcohol right and so if we were to put that in let's see what are we G to get so now if you don't even have like good ones and so the client that I was thinking of drizzle.com is precisely precisely the company that is their case study and it nailed it here right and so we've got all of these delivery companies right at our fingertips and we're good to go so look likee audiences awesome love that about the tool super super great to work with um makes list building I say like list building on a fly you know super easy so then what you can do from here is you could also dig into their filters and do even more so you can filter on top of the lookalike search but then you could also filter over here and so what I really want to call out here a lot of these things are similar to what other platforms have there's a couple things to definitely call out one the industry tags it's very very good for segmentation see if I just put in SAS you know how hard it is to get a list of SAS companies but see we could just put in SAS and there's 101,000 SAS companies on this list and looking through these these are all SAS companies and so we could even go to like page 200 because you always want to check later on SAS companies here we go SAS SAS SAS awesome and so now we have all these SAS companies right and then we could look into their keywords and we could include CRM and so now we have a really great list of SAS companies that are CRM companies moft okay that's a good one Z Zoho Oracle awesome and so what I like about their keywords they have a lot more keywords to choose from than a a platform like apollo.io and the industry tags are far more sophisticated and tagged a lot better so when you're doing really Niche searching ocean. helps out a lot location count is pretty interesting Department size is pretty interesting oh so e-commerce is very interesting so if we if we were to pull this one away and we were to say um what do I want here food and beverage because I'm hungry so let's say fruit right so we have all these fruit companies and then we want to find only companies that are eCommerce companies awesome so then we look at some of these yep Fruit of the Loom okay that I kind of missed it a little bit that's so funny okay so fruital Alum missed it a little bit that's kind of funny and so uh anyway then we so we have this e-commerce filter here over here then we have the social media channels that they are on annual revenue I never really use Revenue but that's fine year founded is pretty interesting I'm trying to see if there's anything else Brands and products is pretty interesting because what this allows you to do is you can look and see if they have any case studies mentioned on their website I haven't found a great use case for this but it is pretty interesting that you could find things like that and then products as well so if I were to put underwear right let's see oh Fruit of the Loom you didn't show up oh wow I'm so sorry ocean that I'm doing to you on my YouTube video but uh I I hope you get the point that you can do really really targeted searches on ocean that you might not be able to do on another platform that hasn't taken as much care with tagging their companies and things like that and even if you just you know take some of these things away right so we'll take away the the fruit and we'll take away Ecommerce and then we'll just look at you know company location we just want it to be in the United States right so they've got 7 million companies tagged in the United States I think LinkedIn has 30 million in total so that coverage is is pretty great for just the United States right um so anyway this is just a quick overview of ocean. that I wanted to give everybody uh It's Quickly becoming one of our favorite platforms that's joining our you know Tex St along with clay and you know everything else that it comes with and uh you know I hope you enjoy this video y\#\# Date Posted: 2024-04-02

\# How to Build Lists of Accounts for Outbound Prospecting and Cold Email

hey so we are going to start this with one of my favorite companies candidly I was a full-time employee at clay for a little while um so Clay is one of my favorite sources to find accounts they have a LinkedIn database that um you know you can query the LinkedIn database for pretty much the same data that's on LinkedIn and uh you can get a lot of different searches that you might not be able to get in in other tools um and then they've got things like being able to to get leads from store leads and all this different kinds of stuff so clay I just start with um because it's one of my favorite tools and I think everybody should become a user um but there's other tools that I also use in my workflow uh as well and so oh and here was the other real reason um we're going to have a whole literally a whole section dedicated to using clay it has absolutely changed the level of Outreach we've been able to do um for ourselves and I think it'll do the same thing for you Apollo is my go-to dat database that if you're just getting started or if you are an agency or or if you're like doing outbound like everybody should have an Apollo account I think everyone should have an Apollo account and everyone should have a clay account but if you're just getting started I think everybody should have an Apollo account their company data and their Persona data is excellent like when we actually talk about finding contact data we're basically only going to talk about Apollo because I've just tried a ton of data sources and I think Apollo is one of the best I I love using their platform um crunch base is another platform to find accounts What I really like about their information is all of the different filters that you could put on there's crazy crazy filters that you could put on in here like their basic info like all the stuff that everybody else is going to give you and then you've also got like website teex stack website traffic by Sam Rush um interest intense signals by bombora like you've got really really great filtering here and so I think crunch base is one that people should check out um if you haven't checked it out already sales Navigator is also a great place to build accounts um owler oh whoops tonight Aller is a great place they're killing me what I like so what I specifically like about Aller is um they have great segmentation of the company filters and so um the same thing with harmonic they also have great company filters and things like that so I I recommend like if you need a list of like SAS companies or like HR tech companies or edtech companies Aller is a great platform for you to do that on um and then we have harmonic which I talked about as well which is another one of my favorite platforms and then built with is the largest technographic website I've ever found for this kind of stuff and so um I suggest these companies for people to build account lists all the time the the ones that we really use um actually I'll reopen those whoops the on ones that we really use all the time though um is Apollo and harmonic and clay and I'll tell you why and why we uch each one so Apollo is really great for just building lists of companies um their filters are very similar to sales Navigator you'll notice that I didn't say sales Navigator because it's really difficult to pull out the list from sales Navigator Apollo basically gives us the the closest thing that we can get from um to sales Navigator and so that's just one of the reasons why it's one of my favorite ones and it's go-to ones their workflow is also really good um we'll do a whole overview of Apollo as well since um when we send campaigns it's basically like we start our list build in Apollo we take it to Clay and then we send to Smart lead for sending so you know all of those three are the top ones that we really use crunch base is great they've got great fundraising information they have great filters the problem with them is you can only save like 5,000 companies per month and that's really limiting to us as an agency and so they're really really great um for low volume stuff and um they've got awesome filters like you can't find companies that attended events on like Apollo they've got really cool filters that everyone should check out but um just a little too low volume for what we do sales Navigator like I said great filters they're the ones who own the data like nobody has better data than them but it's difficult to extract that data I would say that's the same um feedback that I have for owler um owler has phenomenal data um if if you even just look up you know their SEO sites right so just go to Aller Salesforce the data here is fantastic it's it's really really great data you have key events annual revenue their competitors their Acquisitions the funding their Investments news and insights all of this stuff phenomenal stuff it's just um you know it's it they're not that expensive but it's really tough to extract and download lists from ower as well without paying for their like really really expensive plan but worth mentioning harmonic is on the expensive end as well but they allow to download 10,000 companies at a time which is way easier to to work with and so they also have these these sector um filters that I love like just putting when companies they want to Target B2B SAS companies it's so easy to just jump in here and just be like boom B2B SAS or boom artificial intelligence or boom edtech right this they make it ridiculously easy to be able to do this stuff so they're also scanning to make sure that like company headcount and things like that is updated every single day so they've got really really really fresh data their data set is really great for these companies well their data set is really great for a company that's venture-backed right they don't have really great data sets for um for companies that aren't like if you wanted to build a list of pest control companies like harmonic is not going to be your company to do that which I I should add more for for the local business Outreach too and so then builtwith is just great because if you need to find every company that has Salesforce installed on their website builtwith is is amazing for that or if you want to find every company that has stripe installed on their website builtwith is the the best for doing that what I forgot to include because I was talking about really high level um leads was like um how to find local leads and so D7 lead finder is really great for those situations that you need a list of like every pest control company in the United States um and then outc scraper is really great for this as well um and the reason why they're so good is because um these other databases are basically scraping LinkedIn and then providing that data to you um harmonic does some SEC information um as far as I'm aware um D7 lead finder and out scraper are scraping Google Maps so when you think about how you can find lists right you know for these companies LinkedIn is a great place because you know a lot of companies have a LinkedIn profile like that's you know it's it's a normal step like some marketing intern at some point said we should have a LinkedIn company page right and so uh a lot of these companies have these LinkedIn pages but if you're a pest control company you don't care about setting up a LinkedIn account so outs scraper um and D7 lead finder they scrape Google Maps again if you're a pest controll you don't care about LinkedIn but you care about Google Maps and so that's why I really like using their data um in those cases so this is for like the local business Outreach built with is you know building lists of companies who are using certain Technologies it's limited to in Technologies installed on somebody's website so if you're looking for somebody that uses sales Loft I wouldn't check their um website because nobody installs sales Loft on their website but you could check their job descriptions which we'll talk about later harmonic really great for companies that raised money SAS companies their filters are really good Aller has really great data as well with just great data points that you just want to know about these companies and they have great searches like when you get into the platform you would be able to search by you know software internet and computer services and then dig deeper into crms great filters LinkedIn again they're the the owners of all this data um crunch face great fundraising information great filters um just tough to extract things out of Apollo is like the like can like the best average out of all of them to be able to do this stuff and then Clay's got some great account filter stuff as well and so what we as an agency really use is Apollo and clay and then harmonic for more interesting stuff builtwith for more interesting stuff and then local businesses is D7 lead finder and outs scraper but this course is going to be mainly focused on clay and Apollo and so as far as account are concerned these are the top level ones there will be full dedicated modules to Apollo and Clay so you can see exactly what we're talking about

\# Enrich Positive Responses with Data and Send to Slack

we have kind of a fun workflow set up today instead of something that is you know crazy AI type campaign and so what we can do with this clay table that we're going to go over is we will receive any kind of interested response we will then enrich that in interested response we will enrich it for a LinkedIn profile which then we're going to get a mobile number from and then we're going to add that currently to a Google sheet but really what we want to do is send it to a slack Channel and so quite simply the way that this works is you could just go to smart lead and set up your web hook and so I'm not going to go over there right now but you just literally go to the web hook tab add a new web hook and then you'll get a source from clay and you just put the link that Clay gives you into the webhook link that smart lead uh gives you as an input and then you'll be ready to go and then we can map things like their name their email address their lead category what they said in the email body you can even use a formula to um take out all html text and so literally I just asked it you know remove the HTML from email body so then we have a clean email body over here now we're getting all of our data from Apollo in this instance if so then we use that to get the LinkedIn URL and then we're using that to start a waterfall to find mobile phone numbers after that couple problems if you are not using Apollo this part won't work um and if you so we have a couple of different options that you could do right so one option that you can do is usually we have a clay table that is sending data from the initial starting clay table to Smart lead and then something will happen and then we get a response and then we can come back so the other way we could get this data is we could also use lookup uh we can look up a record in another table and then this one is Baton Market bulk campaign 2 and then we could search the um Master email column to equal and then we want it to equal the email in here so we can do this as well which will get us the LinkedIn URL because we're not always the best of putting the LinkedIn URL uh into the smart lead campaign when we send it although we really should um so if you don't have a LinkedIn URL you might have had a table that had a LinkedIn URL and then you can just look it up over there this is just to show you maybe I set this up too quickly and it's not going to work the other thing that you could do is you could just try to enrich for a LinkedIn URL from what you have here and so if you were to do a Google search find an enriched person from a Google search if you just type in if you just literally just input a person's name and then their email address or their website this will will then go out and find their LinkedIn URL most likely you could possibly use Cent to find it as well um lots of different ways that you could do it but Apollo does accept a email as an input right here and then that really helps us you know enrich for their LinkedIn URLs and things like that or you could just not be lazy and be organized and as soon as you're sending data to Smart lead just send the LinkedIn URL to Smart lead with uh the initial input and then it'll show up here and in the lead data which it would show up right here but we don't have that um for now so yeah then we're sending it to Google sheet for now but if you want to send it to a slack Channel you would just set it up in clay so send message to channel and then you can name the bot all this stuff you can name the channel and then for your form information this is where you're going to fill out everything so you would just come in here and you would say like um name and then you're just going to map name right but I'm going to take the second one because the second one's better and then I'm going to come here and I'm going to say email and then we map email right and so in order for us to give our clients the most amount of information that we could possibly give we're going to give like name email here we can even look name email LinkedIn profile the email body that got sent so we want to send that one the category as well we want to send um the LinkedIn URL and then the mobile number to you know all this stuff so yeah hope this was useful careful with the apis from Apollo because they have a really low rate limit we're only sending web hooks if a lead is marked interested or please review and that's not going to get over unfortunately 200 um people per hour so that's just is what it is but yeah I hope you enjoy this video and now you can send slack messages and get way more context for your slack messages um when you get a new lead from your campaigns\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Find Warm Intros In Your LinkedIn Network Automatically

hey everyone one question that I get all the time is how can I leverage somebody's LinkedIn Connections in order to get a warm intro how can I scrape somebody's LinkedIn connections how can I use this data that's on LinkedIn I think I've come up with a way to use clay that gets you a step even better than LinkedIn Connections in some ways and you can do it at scale without bring your LinkedIn account at risk and you would be able to map your entire market across this as well and you could do backwards forwards and all these things this workflow is a little bit complicated I'll be the first one to say that so I'm going to go through this video uh in a very structured way first we're going to talk about why we do it this way and what data does LinkedIn give us so I'm going to go over the LinkedIn profile first and then second we're going to go over the workflow and then third we're going to get into how I would think about actually using this in a campaign so let's jump in Daya in question here is often times people ask me how can I get these Mutual connections to talk to Jordan and the big reason is because if they're connected they want to have some warm intro way to get into you know Jordan get connected and and talk right and so I personally think this is a bad idea on two levels so if you wanted to look up one person at a time and do this which I don't think is a great use of your time unless it's a really great account you could open up a tool like Phantom Buster use your LinkedIn cookie which puts your LinkedIn account at risk scrape these Mutual connections and then look through all of them so the the reason I don't like that method is because you'd be putting your LinkedIn account at risk and you really can't scale it without making LinkedIn extremely angry and so the other reason I don't like this is because if you click on this he has we have 1,300 Mutual connections between the two of us and so I if I were to actually look at this there's not a whole lot of people on this list that I actually feel comfortable going to for a connection or um I'm not even sure if they actually know him so I think maybe he knows Matt and maybe he knows Ben but from this list and I'm pretty good friends with Jordan he knows Veron may maybe he knows Andre but a lot of these people don't actually know him he is just connected with them on LinkedIn there there's no actual connection here and that's often the problem that I see when people do these kind of LinkedIn plays is none of these people actually know them and they can't actually help and and get brought in so now let's turn our eyes away from this section and look at the people also viewed section this section I find to be really interesting because I think the LinkedIn algorithm is doing something here where there's a higher degree of knowledge between these people like I know Jordan knows Jesse for sure I know he knows Justin I know he knows this Justin if we go in through this I know he knows Scott I know he knows this person I know he knows this person I know he knows this person he knows this person he knows this person this person this person I know that he has connections with all these people the hit rate is so much higher and if we even look at my account if I look at my people also viewed I know DK I know Jasper I know Floren I know Yuri I know paraa Pasha I know Joel I know sumith I know Scott uh I don't personally know Josh but I know of Josh Nick I know Kristen I know Jordan of course I know vbob I know Alex I Justin I know so you get my point right so I think this section is full of much better data for us so how do we take action on this data so now if you're with me and you agree hey we should be taking action on this data now I I have a a list of LinkedIn connections here that I enriched with Clay one little known enrichment inside of clay is this people also viewed section this people also viewed section is the exact section that I just showed you as well and it gives you the LinkedIn Ural right here so what we could do is we could enrich this LinkedIn profile and then what we could do is we could write that to another table and see how there's 7,000 rows in here and I have 9,000 potential leads already to be working through right 9,000 and so now what we get is um we have all of this data on these people so this is Paul's people also viewed and I'd be super interested to see if you know Paul or or somebody they actually know each other here but so now what we would be able to do is I can now filter by title I can filter by company name I can enrich The Experience here and I could filter by industry and I could filter by headcount and then I could get a list of people that I actually want to be talking to and reach out to Paul who's on my connections list and say Hey you know do you actually know this person and odds are much much higher that they're actually going to know this person and so another way that you can think about this is you could potentially use this to scrape your competitors customers another way you could do this is you could uh so right now what we're doing is we're going from my connections and then we're finding leads within my connections so we could flip this around and I could upload a prospecting list and I could upload my connections list and then I could see out of all of the people on my prospecting list from there people also viewed are there any duplicates like is anybody in my connections that's also on one of my prospects people also viewed I could do a v lookup against that and and then that's my warm intro into that prospect there and then I know that connection and I I know how great of a relationship I have with them so this is kind of my new I'd call it like a play that you can run once a month or once every two months once a quarter but could potentially lead to some really really interesting conversations because you're leveraging that that Mutual connection level um but you're one you're doing it at scale so you don't have to put your LinkedIn account at risk and then two you um you're talking to people that in my belief from what I've seen and I have asked 10 people at this point and there people also viewed section is highly accurate as well it's a much higher reason you have much more reason reasonability that they actually know each other or there's a higher probability that they know each other reasonability isn't even a word um that you could be reaching out to with them and so uh take this for a spin I think it's super interesting uh if you've gotten to the end of this video Don't Tell clay but uh I know some of you might uh say hey Clay is too expensive to be able to do this and for this oneoff thing it might be I've got some other ideas and so if you make it this far in the video I can just DM me on LinkedIn um and maybe follow up because I might be bad at getting back to you um and there's some apis that be able to help you out that um kind of get off the Clay platform so yeah let me know if you saw this\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Tutorial: Setting Up a Basic Make.com Workflow

in this video we're going to make a make.com workflow from scratch where we're going to take this list of people oh and I already ran it before but anyway this list of people and we're going to find email addresses for these people using clear out email finder API and we're going to do it inside of make.com so you could see like a workflow build from scratch and so like I spoke about in the previous videos you always have to think about first what are you trying to accomplish and what's all of the necess steps to get there and so when you look at clear out clear outs API I need to know the name and I need to know the domain of the company and so where I have that is in my email enrichment flow Google sheet which is where we're going to be able to start from and so all we would have to do is we're going to go to Google Sheets and we are going to click search rows and we're just going to map this out for ourselves and then we're going to pick the spreadsheet email enrichment flow so this module here is going to search all of the rows for email enrichment it's going to search all of the rows so we can just get them as results so we'll hit this maximum number of returned rows we'll put five so it just doesn't go crazy and then we'll hit okay now we're going to set up an API call but what we need to do is we need to run this so that we have actual stuff that we can put into the API call so I'm going to do it without running it so you could see what it would look like but now we're going to go over a little bit of how to read API docs and and all that jazz so we're going to http and we're going to hit make a request so now this is going to open up we look at the API docs and this is basically what we're given this is everything that you need now I am not an expert in reading API docs but I do know that you see like curl x and then post so this means that this is a post command so when we go to Method we're just going to put post and then for the URL we're going to enter this URL as our URL up here now see it has says H here sometimes it'll say headers or sometimes it'll say h so I know that these are my headers so I'm just going to copy and paste them in and I'm going to add a header and so now this needs my API key I'm going to wait and like pause the video to put that in so we'll put the other header in which is content type and just copy and paste them you don't need these quotation marks at the end so it's going to be content type and then we're going to put application J B on now in make it's not entirely obvious like what's going on here but now this is like the actual payload that we're sending to the API so we can copy and paste this and where you put this in make is you scroll down and see how it says body type so this is technically like the body that we're entering into the API and so we'll just put body type we're going to put raw content type application Json and then for request content we'll pull this in now here's what I was saying why we needed to run this one first is because otherwise we wouldn't have everything here in a way that we could see like exactly what the stuff is here so I already named it so it's fine but um if you ran this you'd have like an actual example of a full name here you'd have an exact an actual example of the domain here and things like that but we can work with this so we'll just delete Stephen Morris and we're going to map full name inside of the quotes and then we're going to delete apple.com and then we're going to put the full domain inside of the quotes as well and then we're going to parse the response um as always so now I'm going to hit okay and I'm going to pause the video and put my API key in and now we can resume so now the way that we can test this is we can hit run this module only and then we have all of this data here good it did not give away and so I can put in anything here and I'm even just going to put like Eric at growth engine x.com there we go can hit okay and then it's just going to search and it's going to find the the data so now we're running this one completely automatically and so did we get data back yes we did emails yes that's my email address so we nailed it on this one so now we're ready to continue moving on and so now this is oh so this is really why we'd have to search these rows because now what we can do is we can go to Google Sheets and we can hit update a row and we'll put email enrichment in here again once it finishes this the spinny wheel yeah see it always does that email enrichment flow sheet name and then it's going to ask us for the row number but we have no row numbers to enter in so we'll just keep this the same this is ready to go we'll hit run this module only now see how this ran successfully and we have the row numbers to choose from now we can map over here whoops now we can map into here those row numbers so that everything can get updated so then row number see I have the row number here we'll hit that so now it knows every time it finds a result we're going to enter the email and we're going to drop in the email by adding literally it in just like this email and then we'll add the confidence score as well uh confidence great we'll hit okay and so now this is a very very very basic workflow where we're taking data from here running it through uh make.com using clear outs API key and then it should update the row and add it back in and so now I'm G to pause well so I'm going to hit run and I'm just going to pause it because clear out takes a little bit never mind that was literally two seconds I don't know why it was so fast this time so now we can go back and then we go to our email enrichment flow and see how we have the confidence score and we have the email address mapped in uh over here and so that means that we ran everything that we wanted and this is like a very very very basic make.com um flow setup uh for those of you watching yes I know that there uh whoops I know that there's a clear out integration I just wanted to show how to use the API docs but anyway uh this is a pretty basic setup we'll go over some more um complicated setups in further

\# Business Idea You Could Launch With Clay.com

hey everyone a little bit of a different video today I had a business idea that you could use clay to both fulfill for the business and Market the business and you can also use uh cold email to do both of those things as well I'm not going to start this business at all because I believe in Focus but I think that somebody should probably start this business and I think it would be pretty interesting uh so I get reached out to all the time for B2B influencer type things and I keep PE seeing people talking about the rise of the B2B influencer and all this stuff there's not really a great place to connect with B2B influencers and so I was thinking that somebody should create a Marketplace of all the bdb influencers and then have categorizations of what they talk about and what they post about and their engagement and that those kinds of things and then what you can do is um you know reach out to them and see if they'd want to be a part of the marketplace and then you could reach out to Brands and see if they want to take part in the marketplace and then when you get a brand you could email the creators and then when you get a Creator you can email the brands as well and so you could fulfill the whole thing with Clay so let's jump in and talk about how we would do it so anytime you start a business there are of course problems that need to be solved and things that you need to figure out and so we these the things right off the top of my head that in order to start this business you'd have to be able to do so first you'd have to be able to find B2B influencers second you'd have to be able to find the companies looking for influencers you'd have to email the influencers tag them for storage and then get prospects and get customers right and so actually this is all pretty easy of what you could do so first we're going to start with how do you even find the influencers and so let me just delete some of these things okay so first we're going to find the influencers right ridiculously easy in clay you can hit find people from LinkedIn and then we're going to hit profile number of followers Jack this up to like 10,000 and now we've got a lot people with lots of followers this is going to be 10,000 and above by the way make them located in the United States and then you could even go to let's see their experience and you could find keywords in their current experience or you can find keywords in their headline keywords in their about right so if I were to just put anybody who talked about cold email right with over 10,000 followers right we could just hit preview people and then we would just let this run and then okay so over 10,000 followers with you know cold email in their name in their about section let's talk about like outbound and growth as well so this might take a little bit more but so then we could just download this and put it into a table and you would be pretty set to go as far as the list goes and then we could reach out to these people with clay and if you've seen any of the other videos you can just import them so well you can just import these people and we're going to enrich their profile I'm not going to use the waterfall here I'd like to just use prosp you know that's just me so then we'll hit continue and run and so now we're pulling in all these people right and so now we going to have their LinkedIn profile totally enriched and I can run AI on top of their profile and basically sort them into tags AI works really really well if you say hey these are the 50 tags that I want them to be sorted as or you can even just look for keywords on their profile there's tons of ways that you could do it so then you could just tag them for future use you could get their email addresses I would just pop in and it would just hit add enrichment and then hit prosio find work email and then just let this rip like you would be totally fine with doing that right and so now we have all these influencers who talk about cold email and outbound and all of those things right and then if you wanted to find out what they post about already you can use the LinkedIn post find recent posts by user and then this is going to give you their posts their engagement all of that stuff the likes the comments all of those things and so uh this is where you'd be able to build your list super super super easily and then yeah so we have all these lists and everything I mean I mean the posts and everything so we're good to go on this if you find one that says no posts found the way that clay does this it doesn't use your cookie so there's like a tradeoff in doing this so that's just kind of the way that it is now the way that I would reach out to the brands is I would go over to appify and they have go to their console they have a wait for it they have a LinkedIn ads scraper and so I would scrape the LinkedIn ads library for anybody who's running ads on LinkedIn and basically talk about and then you can extract it's even going to include the ad copy and the media you that's going to include everything right so you're you're going to be able to get all that information then you can email those people people and you could say oh hey like I saw your ad about blah blah blah you know would you want to chat and I think we even do that for somebody here I'll show you this once this loads so see this is all this is actually a literal out uh export from the um appify scrape so see we were doing it for the direct message ads right and then we have everything message format all this stuff the paid by and then we have the sender name we found with AI we enriched it and then we got the email addresses of the people who are running these ads right and then we got a message summarization here Target companies all this stuff sent it to Smart lead we were good to go right so here is where we were just reducing exactly you know what they're sending ads for and uh this actually worked really well we sent like only 198 emails and we got seven leads from doing this uh for a different campaign that we're running for hey reach right so uh this is how I get the attention of the brands and then we have all these people here who are potential influencers and I know what they're posting about so now I could create the the side of the market where I say oh hey and then we can just use AI over here and I have a template for this where we can just find their most recent LinkedIn post which there's a little bit of a bug right now so we would just find their most recent LinkedIn post I'm just going to refresh this great so find their most recent LinkedIn post put it here and then you literally will say I just wanted to reach out because I saw your post about blah blah blah and then just give them the pitch and say hey what we're doing is we're helping uh Brands connect with B2B influencers and we thought you might be a good fit would you be interested maybe you have to do a little bit of I mean everyone here talks about cold email and outbound so I bet everyone here is a great B2B fit and then you'd be ready to go you could launch that campaign we'll save the changes whatever you could launch that campaign and then you get say a couple people back who talk about outbound then Not only would I be using the LinkedIn ad Scraper on appify to find people then I would use a tool like G2 like I would scrape G2 and uh then find all of the sales tech companies and say oh I've got all these influencers would you want to talk about partnering with any of them and then you'd solve it on that side too and so uh I don't know if this is interesting but hopefully it's just like a little bit of amusing of how you can think about using clay that I thought you might appreciate so uh yeah somebody should start this business and Clay can help you fulfill on the entire thing think\#\# Date Posted: 2024-05-01

\# Scraping with Scrapestorm

hey everyone I had a friend who wants to scrape this website and it's actually kind of annoying to do this with instant data scraper so we are going to use scrapestorm to do it and um I'm just going to show you a method that I found in order to make this a lot easier I'm not sure if this is even the best method to do it but so what scrapestorm can do for us is it can like go through all of these paginations and it'll rip through all of them but I don't think that what will happen is so it'll rip through all of them for a but I don't think you could totally set it up for B and so I'm going to show you how we can do this and um you know basically what it would look like so the first thing that we're going to try and we're just going to point out is whenever you're scraping stuff you just want to see how is the page put together so we have this page where it's basically so this is called pagination when you keep having to click and just move over right and so also we want to look at the um the URL and so what I notice about this is if we are in C you see how it says listing. PHP question mark title equals c when we're in C and then what we're when we're on like five it'll change and it'll say Okay current page equals 5 title equals c okay this is amazing because this basically means that it's not random whenever they try to just you know like sometimes there might be a random thing where they just insert code for some reason or just random letters and that's not happening here which is a really good sign so what we're going to try to do first is to see if we can first upload all of the regular links like this and get a scrape going in scrapestorm or do we have to actually upload every single page as a URL like this and I'm I'm about to just show you what I mean so first we're going to create a Google sheet to create all of this for us and then I'll have to pause the video switch to scrapestorm show you what I mean and then keep pushing so the first thing thing is a Google sheet so we'll do sheets. new and we're just going to take this um yeah this one here right this this link right and so then we're just going to put a b c d e and then um it will actually just keep the pattern going for you oh duh that's annoying I didn't know it would do that so instead of you guys watching me do this all right cool so we have the link and so we're just going to make it so that we have every single link here so we're going to delete the A and then we're just going to well we can just move this down to and so we could say equals concatenate put this and then we'll put comma and we'll put this just so that we get all of these now we have all of our links so I'm going to pause the video and I'm going to send us over to scrapestorm and we're going to see if we can set it up like this and if not we have to go another step further all right so now we're in scrapestorm where we are going to upload the list so we're just going to take the URLs oh that's the loom video we just used all right so we're going to take the URLs that we created in the sheet and we're going to put them in here so see how we have all of these URLs amazing so we'll hit create and now we're just going to just test see to see if we can just run this cool so we have all of this cool so it already has everything in \[Music\] here so problem is is yeah I don't think we're going to be able to yeah because what we're going to be good for a well no I I think we should be good so let's try this so we've got all this and then let's yeah okay so this should be fine because what's going to happen is it should scrape all of these pages and it's going to go and it's going to keep paginating until it runs out then once it stops paginating it should go to B and we we could just check that so now we're just going to check on which one of these is the next link so we're going to pick this one and we'll hit scrape in so we'll just see what this link looks like overview reviews jobs WR a review I really want the website ooh all right let's see let's see if we can work around this so looks like we're getting a popup here but it's still showing us the data and so maybe we could still grab it yes it is a detail page I want the website though I don't really need the website wow awful place to work that stinks maybe I really don't want this website so it looks like there's no website here anyway so you know what we don't even need this page because it doesn't seem like there's anything interesting on this side oh we've got the main office in the phone number that could be interesting but no we're just going to leave it so we're actually going to delete this we're not even going to run it so actually all we're going to do is we're just going to see if we can get this page and we're just going to let it rip so the way that we'll know that we are successful is I'm going to go on the other tab so I'm going to hit start so that we can just get this going I'm going to go on Google and I'm going to see what is the first name of the law firm actually no it's all alphabetical so we know that we're successful if we get a company on our list that starts with B so we just actually just have to sit here and just make sure that we get to B and then we'll just let it run so now so we paginated so that's a good sign so we got to 20 and now see this load time here this is just paginating so let's see can we get number three all right so we got to the third page and so we're just going to keep ripping through this I am going to pause the video now and then update you if we get to b or not when we'll see and so finally we got the B I didn't realize there was so many pages on this thing uh I have literally squatted 315 for 10 in the time it took me to go downstairs and check all this so we're good this is how you can do it and I hope this video was helpful as usual\#\# Date Posted: 2024-07-01

\# 109k SaaS Companies For You

we've got a really special special list to show everyone uh I constantly am trying to build a good list of SAS companies and so we have put together a list this has cost a lot of money to to run this list we've put together a list of 109,000 SAS companies here we go and we have scored most of them I actually don't know why those don't have the score but we have scored most of them for How likely they are to be an actual SAS company so I'm going to explain how this happen and then I need some help from you so the way we did this is we pulled every company that looked remotely like a software company from places like crunch base or Apollo or owler and we enriched them we pulled them pulled them all out then we created a workflow in clay to enrich them and so you can see I enriched the the companies I enriched the headcount I did everything we then used serper dodev which I can't open because it's going to show its uh my API key see how we created this Google Search here we use serper dodev to then go find the zoom info page and then we found things like it's Revenue the address its founding year all this stuff and the descriptions and then we found the industries and so see it says telecommunications here it says software here it it you know it says retail whatever it says software here and you know all these things so basically then we moved on and we looked at crunch base and we used zenos to scrape crunch base and we found all the data that crunch base offers as well and then we scraped owler and then we scraped Apollo and everything too and so basically what we did was then we combined all of these things into one formula over here this keyword lookup and we found how often do software keywords come up and so you could see these the keywords that we're searching for once it loads we want to see how often do software keywords look up the only other thing that I kept out was we also scraped their website using Google searches in order to find classic software eords so we scraped their site to see if they mentioned any keywords here and then we looked for any of these keywords here to exist on their website from Zoom info from crunchbase on their LinkedIn company description whatever it might be and then we got a score of how often those keywords show up over here right and so now what I need your help with is I think this is one of the most complete lists of SAS companies uh that I've ever put together but there's a couple of kinds of companies that are slipping through the cracks and so uh agency businesses are slipping through the cracks when they say that they help software companies they help SAS companies or other service based businesses are slipping through the cracks and so sometimes there are companies with two keywords and they're just not good and you know like look this is an office in products and retail company like this isn't doesn't seem like it's a software company right and so uh you can usually just filter out two but sometimes there's uh companies with you know one keyword that's still a SAS company so now there's also 46,000 rows and I filtered it for 34,000 rows there's 109,000 companies in here and so what I'm going to do for a little bit is if you're seeing this video now for about the next two weeks I'm going to open this up for comment uh access and if you ever manually go through these websites could you comment and say you know only comment if you think this is not a SAS company if this starts getting too spammy and people get out of control I'm going to shut it down and I'm gonna uh remove the the access but one day we are definitely going to Output this with all of the company information you want to know like the company headcount their industry their description and all these things at that point I'll switch the um Link in this YouTube video to the updated list so if you're seeing you know this I'll also probably change the title of the video of you know we built a list of you know how many SS companies but yeah if you could help out and you know help me score these manually that'd be really great because like we look at this and it got a one Empower your business with Rock Solid Talent see they just help tech companies like they're not actually a tech company versus this company they got a two and see they get ready to take control of your software projects so they're probably you know helping but see they got a 69 nice and this is an inventory management software who has a G2 page right so the so these scores are definitely helping us out right like this 128 imagine fintech marketing Consulting see sometimes these are bad too that's kind of crazy maybe we should see if Consulting is on any anyway I'm going to drop this let me know if you can help\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# How to use Make.com: Setting Variables and Parsing Text

so in this video I'm going to go over a workflow that I've already created this workflow essentially it takes our smart lead API key and takes the analytics from Smart lead and adds it to clickup um I'm not going to rebuild this one but what I'm going to do is I'm going to show different things that we did so that you can see kind of how I think through this process why we set it up this way and and how it all goes so now you're you're thinking through this process right and the first thing you need to think about is what am I trying to do I'm trying to get smart lead analytics from Smart lead into clickup so I can have a project management overview so you look at smart leads API documentation which will'll probably do a workflow build um probably after this video in order to do that you look at smart leads API documentation and in order to get the campaign analytics the first thing you need is you need the campaign ID and so then you think to yourself and you're like okay where's the campaign ID and how could I pull it in so so what we could do is we could query like all we could query the smart lead API and get every single campaign and we could get all the campaign ideas and then we could run it like that campaign IDs but the reason why we don't want to do that is because I don't actually want to keep track of every single campaign I only want to keep track of the campaigns that are in my clickup so it's like okay so the campaigns are going to be in clickup so we made it a standard operating procedure to put the URL of the smart lead campaign into the clickup task so that we would be able to do exactly what's here so that means we're going to start with listing all of the tasks first and so in so clickup is going to start as our source right and so um we used list all tasks and this runs uh on a scheduled like run so if you want it to run every 12 hours you literally just set that up where it'll list all tasks and then we schedule the settings so every 12 hours we get new data populated in so so we set all of this up again if you need support on setting this stuff up ask chat gbt with web browsing turned on of how to do this because it's like it it could be kind of a monster to to set this up by yourself and with the AI browsing the web it's a really good support companion for you and so here we're listing all the tasks so if we hit refresh it might change from 96 tasks to 10 yeah so now it goes up and now we're good to go and so we're just going to hit okay so now we know that this one's ready to go now we have a text parser this is one that I didn't know how to use when I first started using make and this is a perfect opportunity to go over this right now and so oh actually before we get there so sorry see how we have this filter here I am basically filtering to ensure that if I'm pulling a campaign the only reason it's going to continue working with the workflow is if the text contains app. smart le. that is the text that I want to pass through because that is what the campaign cign has inside of it so the only time that we keep passing data through is if this custom field which is the campaign URL for smart lead has app. smart lead. the way we set up the filter is you literally just click on you click on the lines connecting these things and then you just set up your filter and we did a contains filter and and there we go then we have our text parser again I didn't know how to use this when I first started using make.com great time to go over this and so um in order to set this up essentially what we're doing what what we're doing here is we're separating it by the the pattern here and this is what we entered in here again I am not a make.com master um the way we put this in and I knew to put this in was because I knew that I wanted the custom fields from Smart lead which is wherever it is that's the kind of annoying part about make doas you have to like search through this stuff to to find it so I knew that I wanted that that and then I use chat GPT to say like how do I separate it so that it's like appsmart le. and then at that backs slash I want that number and so then we use the the text parser to get that done and so then that passes through and then we're doing and now we have the campaign ID which the text parser pulls out that campaign ID for us and then it goes to the smart lead HTTP request which I have to pause the video so I can cover up my um apit so when we open this see how then it's the fallback match that we get that's how we're going to query the API key because this fallback match that we got from the text parser is precisely what we need so we need this number right inside of the API key and then we can get all of our data which then edits the task inside of clickup and we get our smart lead analytics hooked up for us now uh you see this part going up with it as well what is this now what we're doing is uh one time we had a problem with a client because there we sent 20,000 emails for them or something like that and their open rate in the beginning was like 80% and then their responses just basically fell off the cliff of the earth and I and I didn't know why and I didn't have any tracking on it the reason why is we had an email deliverability problem and so we went from like an 80% open rate to like a 133% open rate but because my analytics all said you know it said the open rate of the campaign was like 65% because we went so long at 80% and then the average with 133% became like 60% or whatever it was and so then I was like Oh shoot what we need to add in is we need to every time we run this update we need to um check what the analytics were for yesterday so not only do we have an open rate all time we have a yesterday open rate as well so when you use the smart lead um when you use the smart lead analytics you can set a date range and so I wanted to set a range from um yesterday to today and I wanted the analytics of of all of our campaigns so you use tools inside of um make.com in order to set that and so the way we came up with this again I asked chat TBT I was like how can I set the variable value inside of the tools to um basically output the date for yesterday and so then this is what it told me and this is exactly what you do and now when we pass through and I just got to pause again so now when we pass through you usually my API key would be here but now when we pass through we have the campaign ID here and then we have the start date of the analytics which is coming from our settings and then we have the end date over here as well so that now we can query it and then we can edit everything and then we're good to go so this is a good example for one of how I think about these things but then two using chat TPT to do things that you have no clue how to do in in make.com um but you can just get it done and if there's any questions about that like literally this is is this is how I would do it um so like the most recent one we were talking about is this tools one right and so we'll just open this up and I literally just prompt it like this I turn on web browsing and I just say um I'm using make.com to build a workflow I want to use the tools module to set a variable so that I can input yesterday's date into my workflow how should I create how should I set the and then we just look at what it is the variable value so that I can um input yesterday's date into the rest of my workflow and then you're going to let it run and so it's going to browse the web and it's going to go find things right and this is honestly when you're using make.com anytime I don't know how to do something I just go straight to the um I just go straight to chat gbt and so we'll just pause to just get this answer I don't know how long it's going to take and so you see here um at first gave me an answer that was like it was okay it like found the right page and then I was just like oh what would the actual function be to subtract the days and then it's add days add days and then if you go to here oh I mean I'm already on it this is exactly how we would get it done right so it's today and then it would be like minus two so add days would be minus two we'd go from 128 to 126 so then we could hop over and you see our variable is today and so this is how we set like today's date so format date minus one and then that's how we got yesterday so again when I was figuring out make.com I didn't have chaty and like all this other stuff definitely definitely just leverage chaty P if you ever get stuck it'll really help you so you don't have to read all the support documentation and everything so I know this probably wasn't that helpful for setting up an actual workflow I really just wanted you to see my thought process behind it and we'll set up an actual workflow um after this so here we go\#\# Date Posted:

\# Quoting Bad Google Reviews in Our Cold Emails

you may have seen me talk about this in other places but for 2025 what we are doing for companies is we have set up an infrastructure that we can launch campaigns for them for free and this was one of the tests that we did that worked out really well and I really like the workflow so I wanted to go over it so as you can see we sent to 195 contacts and we got four positive responses what we're trying to do here is we're working with a reputation management company and what they do is they remove bad Google reviews only and they only get paid if they remove the reviews so they told me they sent 3,000 emails and they got no responses and so you could see we sent 195 and we got four and hopefully they'll become a customer uh pretty soon because this was just a free test we did for them um and if you are a B2B company that your LTV is over i' would say $5,000 I'd love to run this for you as well too so basically you could see what we did was we sending people emails this was a quick test I was basically saying I had a question about the negative review I saw on Google the one about RG Roofing doing substandard carpentry work that wouldn't pass inspection so this part we're AI generating right here and then we're just putting the the offer in and so then they said can I choose the removes the reviews that are removed cool um the one about the insulation of dust bursting into the attic how much do you charge and then this one I love this one so this person we said the one about Diane providing excuse after excuse and no action and then we sent this email to Diane and they said wow you actually read the reviews that's impressive give me a call tomorrow to discuss so The Way We Were doing this is we were just using the Google integration inside of clay and so what you really need to be able to pull this off is you need the the find business reviews text and keywords but before you do that you need the place ID so to find the place ID we were just using the website of the the company and then once we had the website we would then get the place ID put it in here and then we used a formula to just get the reviews that are below um four stars and then I just used AI to p out and again 400003 I used AI to pull out just one bad review so that we could turn it into a um a response like this so the one about poorly managed place with intim communication about kids progress okay cool whatever so I know this is a two-minute video but I think it's a really impactful campaign I if you are targeting any local businesses and you want to say anything about their reviews this is your key here guys get that place ID find the business reviews I'm pretty sure you could use this do this with server. as well too and be even cheaper but uh I just wanted to show this workflow because it was really fun you could do this for good reviews you could do this for bad reviews you could use this as just a PS line to to show people that you actually looked up their website I just really like this one and I wanted to share it so uh yeah and if you want to run a free test and you are a B2B company with an LTV over $55,000 I have 2,000 inboxes that are warming up for you right now and we can rent out and we can just test the campaign for you for free just sign up for the wait list down below

\# Import Unlimited Leads into Apollo.io

hey everyone so in this video what we're going to go over is how you can use the import feature in Apollo to start utilizing Apollo as your source of Truth across all of your uh companies your customers wherever you get email data from you could bring it back into Apollo and you can leverage Apollo's database their UI their filters everything to be able to do so and so I'm going to show you how to do that very quickly and so all it takes at first is first we're going to see see how we have this person I used to work with this person and I have never accessed their email on Apollo but I know what their email is and so I'm just showing you that I have never accessed this person's email address before and so if we go to our search and then we go to people all I'm going to do is I'm just going to import I'm going to bulk import from CSV because this is the way you could do it up to 100 000 records at a time and I'm going to show you that all you need is just the email address so see this is the email uh sorry Katie for putting your email out there like that but all you need is the email address and it will unlock the entire credit for you so then we can just click on import here and now it's going to unlock Katie's email for us and we didn't pay a credit for it uh you can see my credit usage were already maxed out I'm on an Apollo license and we're an Enterprise license that we're already basically maxed out um and so we didn't use a credit to accomplish this and um it's also syncing with my HubSpot which is another big thing and so if we were to go to you know 10x incubator and look at employees oh actually this was under project 10K I don't know why 10x incubator is coming up here um but anyway we now have the email address of the person uploaded to our Apollo account and it didn't use any of our credits uh so yep we love using this function when we're using different data sources like lead IQ seamless maybe icy leads lead hype we validate the emails first and then we put them in here because they will just put in the email address that you said was the real email address um not they won't validate they won't just give you any email address and things like that so definitely pre-validate the email addresses before you put them into Apollo but now I have this contact as a part of my UI and everything and now I can filter it in Apollo and it just makes a lot of sense to have it in here\#\# Date Posted: 2024-08-01

\# Automatically Creating Offer Messaging and Apollo Links from a Website Input

everyone there's basically two things that are important in this clay table that I want to show and everything else is kind of a mess so I'll try to keep this organized in this clay table what we've basically done is we can upload a website as an input and it does two things of importance and everything else is a mess one it creates three versions of copyrighting of different ways to present the offers of the company without uh and not not without it includes presenting the offer in ways that the case studies from the website talk about their offer or whatever we can gather from the website and then we also generate Apollo links which you might be looking at here these Apollo links are also based off of the case studies of the website too and so this table is a gigantic mess because I tried multiple different data providers to see what would work best but this is basically what happens we upload the website over here and this website then triggers a workflow where we scrape the web website with zenos and then we use clent to go out and find the case study of the customers as well so now both of these things are going to feed the three different kinds of offer copy that we can write which if you're just watching this video and you want to see some things here's an example for HubSpot and we're based off of one of their case studies I guess and we're saying if we could help you increase your deal Generation by 180% with smarter prospecting would that be interesting if we could help you achieve 96% more Revenue through integrated sales and marketing tools would that be useful to you if we could help you close 75% more deals using an all-in-one CRM platform is that something you'd want to check out and so see how actually this nailed it so you could obviously see I made a template and I'm forcing it into that template every time but see how we're talking about HubSpot here as a prospecting solution as a marketing solution and as a CRM platform so it kind of got all the case studies that most people use HubSpot 4 and made offers for them so the way that we generated that is again we use zenos to get the scrape of the website and then we use Cent to find the case studies then again we use AI to then create an ideal customer profile as well which if anyone wants to see that prompt this is basically what it looks like we want to figure out their headcount ranges the industries they target the job titles all these things and we basically use their website content and then the result from the case studies inputs to generate all of these things and so now when we onboard a new customer we upload this as a website and then we automatically have some messaging around their offers and we'll talk with them about everything else that needs to get done and then it also generates an Apollo search link over here that I'm just tweaking a little bit and we might see later what I'm tweaking it for but then it also generates an Apollo search link based off of their case studies so that we can find more customers that look like their case studies and then have at least a very relevant Apollo list in front of us to start with so again we're just using AI um AI if you didn't know just knows pretty well what the search links uh of these platforms look like so you can you know train them and use them or they don't even have to know what the search links look like it's if the search link is the same every time that's how they can generate them pretty well we're starting to switch all of our platforms over to 40 mini as well or all of our models over to 40 mini as well the cost is just insane and so basically this is what we're doing we're just trying to create an Apollo link and uh we base it off of the ideal customer profile the target job title response and then the key we also create AI generated company keywords that we should exclude as well too and then we basically have this gigantic prompt and I trained it on four examples so it saw a lot of what the Apollo link looks like and so for HubSpot this is what it would basically generate for HubSpot there is one problem that I'm just trying to tweak out of it right now but I just wanted to show all of you see how the job titles I don't know about but this is exactly the kind of job titles I would expect HubSpot would want to be targeting anyway and then we have the industry and keywords the only problem I'm oh and the employee head count is also nailing it too the only problem we're seeing is it's still adding in competitive keywords and I need to stop that because I'm sure HubSpot wouldn't actually want to sell to any of these companies that offer this stuff but then all of these are still pretty good targets for them uh and maybe it's generating that see how the count didn't change too much maybe generating that and then in our exclude keywords it was taking care of it nope it wasn't anyway so then that's just the last tweak I need to make is just watching out for competitors but uh anyway so now when we onboard a new customer we can create some offer messaging for them right off the bat based off of case studies they already have on their website and then we could create a highly targeted list based off of case studies they have on their website and then we can alter these lists as needed and those kinds of things so anyway just a little upgrade of uh what we're using AI for in the agency\#\# Date Posted: 2024-05-01

\# Target Companies That Recently Had Someone Leave a Role

hey in this video we're going to go over how you can build a list of companies that recently had somebody leave the company so then you can use that in your Outreach so this is a little bit similar when you reach out to somebody and you say hey I noticed you're hiring for a VP of marketing but instead now we're going to say hey I noticed that Josh just left as a VP of marketing how are you going to replace the work that they were doing and then you can manipulate that like if you run a Service Company you can talk about replacing them a service or if you run a tech company you can talk about how you know you can help the team while that person is way and things like that so the way that we're going to do this is we're going to use clay to get this done essentially this first step all you need to do is find a list of people who recently started a new role because if they recently started a new role they also recently left a new role as well or they left their old role too there's no database that really has this you know as a button like you can't just click a button and say I want everybody who ended an experience a month ago that that's not really a thing and so um yeah so we're just going to Target as best as we can if we have company level filters we would H there's probably different ways that we would do it but we're just going to do it kind of blanket in this way so we would just hit find people from LinkedIn and I'm going to make so you could also use sales navigator for this too and if you wanted to you could trust um you try to trust Apollo's data too and that's I mean I've noticed that it's just not the the greatest um for you know they'll say like oh people who've started their job in the last month you could use that too and then enrich and clay and really try to find it but so the big thing is here is we want somebody in the United States and I want them to have Marketing in their title woof hang on everybody all right we're back so we want Marketing in the title and then we want their experience minimum months in current roll we're not going to do anything maximum months in current roll we're going to put one and we're just going to ride with that okay cool so we're just going to do that you could increase it if you put like two you could still probably use that three is probably pushing it a little bit but anyway I don't want to get a Million results here so so hit preview people and we'll just let this run great so now we have a list of all these people that recently started a marketing role and then we could just import them and we're going to enrich their profile because we need to look back at their previous company and see the most previous role that they had so all this data loaded in and all I've added is the um so we've enriching the LinkedIn profile and all I've added here is a filter list of objects because what I want to do is I want to find an experience that is not current for them so then we could jump in here and so we have a filtered array and now this person works at red hat but see how they were an event coordinator ah we also we also need to filter it again so here we go we'll do another one we also want to filter the array for anything that does not contain that com the company domain here so we will do experience and then insert all of these and then we just need to find the exact value so we'll just go in here and we'll go to experience and then we'll just hit we could use this which I'm not going to use and there's a couple reasons why but I'm not going to get into it now so we'll use company domain so we just have to type in company domain exactly how they have it and then we want it to does not contain and then we want again company domain and then we'll run this and now this will break it down so you can get a list of companies that they used to work at and so then the last thing that we can do is we can basically matap this end date and then we can literally just add a formula is this date within the last two months and then we'll just map the end date of the most recent experience that they are not working at anymore which you see like the hit rate isn't going to be amazing on this I'm being completely upfront about this see this person is basically the only person we can reach out to because a lot of these people got promotions and so the reason why they're most they have a new experience in the past couple months is they they got a promotion and that's their new experience and they used to be working at another company so that just so you know that's just the way it's going to be and then we'll hit this and then we have okay so then we just have to add this uh if and date is not empty is this date it well see then we get true Right Here and Now what we can do is we would run the rest of these obviously then you could I mean honestly you could do whatever you want you could create another view and we're going to say okay this view is recent date check contains true great so now we've got 13 people you can hit add people whoops they added they changed the UI here so then we can just hit find contacts at company and then we would save results in a new table so that it's free and then what we're basically doing is we're basically like targeting this view oh so interesting recent roll example video and then we would be doing not company domain we actually I guess would we need to map the the new domain to be completely honest so then we'd have to come in here and we'd have to say this is the company domain Target this domain that we would create this column and then you would do a look up over here and then we would say hey notice you recently lost person we can help boom boom boom boom right and so uh yeah that's how you could do the targeting uh you could probably end the video now I'm just going to finish this for people who don't know how to use clay as well to just get all the way to the end for you so then we would just use the contacts company save results a new table and we would do recent roll example and then Target this domain and then copy of default view so now we're only doing it for these people and then so we have anyone with marketing in their role so I want to Target anybody with like Chief marketing or CMO um CEO notice how here I'm putting um I don't really like to put Chief marketing officer or like the way their keyword search works is it's just looking for that keyword to exist so if I were to put marketing it would be everything uh but if I put Vice marketing I'll get everybody who's a vice president of marketing I'll get everybody who's a VP well I won't get a VP of marketing so we'll do that like I don't put any of the ofs in there or anything so anyway then we do that and then we can just hit preview people and then you can continue with your clay workflow to find the email addresses and sequence them and do all of those things um as well and see how we have all of these people you know with these matches across just you know essentially 13 companies here that's essentially how you would get this done\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# How Salespeople can use Vlookup

all right so I created a new column and we could just do this all over again I created a new column and I could say I want to match people into this column to see if they match this over here and it always needs to be to the left you could do another thing called index match but we don't have to get into that right now so for vlookup everything always has to be to the left of the column if it were over here it's not going to work so we're going to say I mean if it were over here on the right it wouldn't work so we're going to say equals vlookup and then I want to see does this exist in my other list so I'm going to click on that and then I'm going to put comma and then I'm going to go highlight my entire other list which if you go in here and you click on this column here you've now selected the entire column here uh to be to be listed so now I'm telling it look at this this right here and find anything that matches on this one does that make sense all right then we put a comma and then we're going to say one the reason we're saying one is because I want you to the result I want you to return me is column one um sometimes if it's like you have the website here the company name here and then their email address over here you might want to link it up by the website but return the email address so if you wanted to return the email address then that would be that would be column three out of your selection because the vlookup could work like this too and you could have three columns selected and then you just put column one as what you want the result to be that's another way that it could work and then we'll just finish this off one and then we're going to put false and so false is basically saying you put false because you want an exact match you could put true and actually I'm just interested to see how that would affect our list you could put true and it's not an exact match and see how it's already messed up like these are these like so there's no point in doing a a true one but it's a non-exact match you always want to do an exact match though so we'll do false and then we'll get the same exact results and then you can just pull it down so yeah that's vlookup\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Targeting Open Jobs Cold Email Workflow

one really common way to find companies with intent is to Target them by their open job titles so if you're a company and you're trying to see you know who is in need of new graphic design software or you want to see uh who might be in need of a new Salesforce implementation going to people's job boards and seeing what they're hiring for is a really great way to have an understanding about what kind of problems the company is facing and what is the future of the company look like for the next 3 to six months and so in the beginning of this video we're going to go over a couple of ways to just get the information and then we'll go over a very simple way to reach out and Target companies that are doing this if you just need to get it done and you want it to be super easy and then we'll go over my uh my favorite way to Target companies um and of course it's going to include clay.com but uh a lot of the principles stay the same if you're using other tools and so the first one we have open is just LinkedIn jobs and so uh if you look at the stats more job postings get posted on LinkedIn than any other platform so it's a really really good place to get started this is really great for like white collar jobs though when you switch to say like blue collar jobs a lot of them are poting on Indie so it's kind of like linkedin.com is number one indeed.com is number two as far as overall job postings obviously LinkedIn is better for white collar and then indeed still has white collar jobs on it don't get me wrong but then they'll have like more like plumbing and HVAC and things like that and so if you want to grab uh job results from LinkedIn the best way probably to do this is is to go to your LinkedIn jobs and create your search and you could I'm looking for sales development representatives in the United States I could add in more things like posted uh you know in the past 24 hours there's 936 wow that's kind of crazy uh so in the last 24 hours there's 936 uh of these here and we could pull this out we can pull this out using Chrome extensions uh I wouldn't use anything that automates the the pagination so see how we have like 1 2 3 4 5 six seven eight I wouldn't grab use anything that automates that pagination so I would use something like Clays Chrome extension which see how it's grabbing all of the job titles for us and everything like that so clay Chrome extension would be able to do that don't use a Chrome extension like instant data scraper if you want to do this more automatically at scale Phantom Buster would be able to do this for you and so if you were to just search Phantom Buster LinkedIn jobs so they have the the scraper over here for this and um you know sign up for Phantom Buster and you can use it over here so you have your LinkedIn job scraper here you will need your LinkedIn cookie um the other place that you'd be able to get jobs data like Target companies who have open jobs is Apollo as well you can jump down to your job postings currently hiring for and then sales development representative and then we be able to put that in and then we can filter on anything that we want on top of that as well the only thing that I really don't like about um Apollo's jobs data and I don't know why they do this is so if you look for jobs right which is in here something job postings see how they're only showing like the first 10 and I don't even really know like where sales development representative even is so then we jump on here and we're like okay this is Google hiring what other jobs does Google have here let's go to Google what are the jobs do they have jobs and then we'll say sales development representative right oh cool so none of these are actually sales development Representatives so that's one problem that I have with uh with Apollo's search is is like if you use it you have to use it as kind of like wide open targeting you can't and then they're not going to tell you what the open job is so you can't use that in your Outreach and yeah so it's a little bit tough to do this stuff at scale uh Jordan Crawford one of my best friends he has intent. blueprint goom market.com this is a phenomenal platform in order to find uh people who have open job titles and you could get exports from here I would be remiss if I didn't uh talk about his tool and then you could also get lists of jobs from clay.com so once this loads up you can hit new table and then we can hit find jobs from LinkedIn and we could just put in sales development representative open that up and then I can hit United States what's this recruiter button has a recruiter oh great okay and then we can hit preview jobs and now we'll get all of these jobs so let's see how close this is to so obviously when guys when you scrape data it's not going to be the same thing as live data there was 947 sales development representative jobs posted in the last 24 hours we can't expect the scraped databases to have the same coverage so we'll see what that coverage is oh so 3,28 rolls that's pretty dang good so this doesn't account for like things closing and things like that but this is pretty dang good in comparison to what we had before for our sales development uh roles and so Clay is another one that you'd be able to get the information here for and then if you are interested in scraping indeed appify has a really great indeed scraper that you can use um and yeah it it does a really really good job so now to kind of the the second half of the video These are a ton of the platforms that you'd be able to find the open jobs data from second half of the video we're going to talk about how we would actually put these campaigns together and so again our first one is going to be using Apollo and so Apollo is kind of like I said it's it's the quick and dirty way to get this done where if you just want to find people and so let's say you want to Target people who are hiring for accountants because you have like an accounting based solution and you know they want to expand their team and you want to talk to the the head of Finance or the CFO right so we'll put that and then we'll put like Chief Financial Officer and then we want to know that they're hiring oh not funding my bad we want to know that they're hiring for accounting accountant Finance I know my video is in the way a little bit here so I'm going to scroll as much as I can sorry so now you'd have a list of companies that are hiring for these roles and we could clean it up of course we could put United States and we could put you know number of employees up to 50 that kind of stuff and so this is like the quick and easy way to do this the best thing that you could really say in your Outreach though is that you're you know hey Brian saw your job ad where you're trying to expand the you know uh expand the finance team or something like that because you don't actually have the role that's basically the best thing that you can say but if you're a person who's just getting started or you want an easy way to get this done Apollo has this where you could get it done really really really easily now if you wanted to do it in a more advanced way what we could do is we could go back to Clay and so we could say Okay I want anyone who is hiring for a sales development representative in the United States and I'm just going to limit this to 500 so we don't go crazy so we're going to hit preview jobs I'm going to let this load the next time you see the screen we're going to be on the the clay workflow and sorry I already set up uh an active job openings because I was I uh forgot I wasn't filming and so basically now what we can do is we have the company name we have the title that they're looking for we have the company domain and then we have the LinkedIn URL and so what we need to do here is we're going to remap the company name the job title and the location just because what we really want is we really want the description of who they're trying to hire and why and what we're able to do with this is we're able to use AI on top of it and there's a template in here I'm pretty sure and if there's not I'll make one all right so we'll put the oh we don't have the company description oh I guess this is just based off of the job title so I'll just make one real quick so we could say using the input tell me what this company is trying to solve for by hiring the role this is the input and I don't know if it's useful uh keep if it's useful I'll show you how I put this into email keep the output under you know 15 words and use keywords from the input complete the output with my prefix every time this is my prefix boom uh I noticed you're hiring you always want to start this quick tip you always want before you call out a job title you want to manipulate the sentence so you say the because if you say I saw you're hiring for a sales uh representative but then you um I don't know it sometimes doesn't flow when it's uh like if you're doing job titles and for some reason it's like sales representative then for some reason one of them is like operation sales associate or something like that that it's not going to flow because it's going to say a operation sales associate and not an operation sales associate so you want to manipulate it so it's the so it's like I notice the open uh roll for the and actually let's not repeat the both times an open roll for the job title position figured uh it looks like you want to bring them on to help and then whatever right and so then that's going to be the prefix and so we'll hit save and run and now we'll get this this line for ourselves the way that we would improve the accuracy I I wouldn't trust this to put it straight into an email right now candidly uh see yeah exactly so see how sometimes it says I noticed and then sometimes it just does the output what we would do is we would or well we can do it right now like we can just take this and now we can just train the data and so we would just say like we would copy and paste all of this and then I would replace description with what we have oh I forget which one we copied hang on so we're going to take this one right great and then we'll take this one after so now the way that we can train this is we can take this and then we'll take out the description and then I'll put in the description from the first one which is what we got the output from right and then we'll take this and this is sales development representative cool and so this is all the examples and then we'll just copy and paste this I noticed you're hiring to help and then we'll take this from our accelerate the recruitment process for candidates seeking high paying careers in Tech sales excellent so now we'll run this so now every single time we do this output it's always going to say I noticed an open roll for the blah blah blah blah blah because um we trained it on that data and so then that's how we like fix it to make sure that we're ready to send this to uh anyone right and so now again the whole reason why we're using Clay is like so that we'd be able to call out the person in the we be able to call out the job title and then we be able to say something interesting about the job description you can prompt this to say whatever you want about the job description like what does this person have to be capable of um if there's three things that would make this person successful what would it be and then you could put it into the prompt and so then you'd be able to keep finishing this flow where then what we could do is we can uh find contacts at the company using the find contacts integration find their email addresses hook it up to a email sequencing tool and we would be all set to run this and so this is how you could look at doing a uh like targeting companies who have open jobs you could do it the easy way in Apollo and you're going to lose some control and you won't be able to personalize the message or you could use clay to do it and then you could personalize the message a ton uh either way you know whichever one gets you a better result is what we're after and I hope you enjoyed the video and this explanation\#\# Date Posted: 2024-04-01

hey everyone in this video we are going to go over how we can score e-commerce Brands by their General average order value and then how we can manipulate the average order value and combine their web traffic in order to make a really custom line about their um average order value the traffic and then depending if you increase Revenue by a certain amount of traffic we'd be able to do the math and say that we think we can increase their revenue by a low range and a high range all so that we can send better emails to e-commerce brands so check this one out it's pretty cool for just scoring Ecom Brands by average order value but then going all the way to create messaging all right so let's jump straight in so we have built a list of companies that are using Shopify plus and we basically have nothing in here except for the Shopify plus part and so I wanted to first show you that we first in order to find the average order value we were trying to use cagent but you know clent was not giving us the actual results that we were looking for so instead I just used the Google shopping integration inside of clay so now when we scale this and we're going to I'm actually planning on making a list of e-commerce Brands and just keeping it and storing it but when you do Shopify Brands sometimes companies that have Shopify installed aren't actually e-commerce Brands and so you want to do one way to verify it is if they have a Google shopping uh link or a Google shopping Marketplace or something whatever you might want to say so we're using that integration in clay right now the only thing you got to be careful about is when you're doing Google shopping it's scraping everything for every search word that you have in there so see how this says no matches found because when we're in here this is not the same domain this link is not the same and then we even have over here see how we have 60 results but only 55 were found over here all we want to do is we just want to filter the list of objects that whatever website we're looking up we want to make sure that we can find the uh actual website in the link so then there's no messiness and we know all of these are actually coming from the website that we think they're going to be coming from and so we're using this inside of clay for right now um but we are going to switch to serper dodev when we run this for real so see how you could just search the brand of a company can't even think of another company brand right now um so now we just search it and just for two credits we can get everything back and then yeah it's it's great that we got this from Amazon but then see how we'll get it from Road at some point we'll see I guess the other thing you could do is you could look up the title to see if the title includes the brand so that would be a good one for road but wow that's so funny you can't even buy it off the website awesome well anyway see how it includes the price and then it includes ratings and things like that as well for maybe like noble project which is the other one yeah this is Rogue Fitness but this one's from Noble project.com so that's going to happen far more often right and so um it's way cheaper to use s.dev so we'll be swapping that out and then you can filter a list of objects and now you've only got uh products that definitely come from the website that we're looking up so then what we did is we wanted to basically I wanted to B be able to say a line like hey you know I was looking at your website action I'll just show you what I wanted to send I was doing some research and it looked like a typical order on your site be around blah blah blah in aov assuming someone purchased item reference so we have this huge prompt here to basically say like if it's this aov multiply times three because people are going to buy multiple and if it's lower than that they're just going to buy one whatever we're just going to take it like that and then um we basically just then get an output that looks like this so I was doing some research and it looked like a typical order on your site might be $150 assuming someone purchased three items such as night te Primal packet ignition and that's first form okay that makes sense I was just and it looked like 219 if someone purchased a snowfall down Smoke Tree by balam Hill okay so I'm gonna then go in here and oh so I'll just manipulate it live for everyone actually um and we'll just change this and so we'll say do not include the name of the company and need output we sending these sentences to that company they know so then we'll rip this again and then when this runs I think it was this one yeah and so we'll want this one to run in particular and of course it's the last one to run okay great and come on any day now yeah cool so then it fixed that so very very nice Okay cool so now we need to get the multiplication times a web traffic number so how the heck are we going to get web traffic in the beginning anyway so the way we're going to get web traffic is every similar web programmatic page ever well maybe not ever but every similar web Pro you see we have the similarweb.com back website hun a000 pharmacy. it they're all just created that way so we can actually create a formula where we just take the normalized URL over here and then we just create the link like that and then we get a zenr scrape now you're going to scrape zenr you have to turn on um you have to to do similar web you have to turn on the rendering of the JavaScript and you have to use a premium proxy now if I were to run this again I just found out that crunch base has semrush data that's publicly available with Zen Rose well when you scrape it with Zen Rose so I'd probably start with that first and then anything that was missing I would move to similar web because this is just much more expensive to run on Zen Rose and Zen Rose is pretty cheap so it's not the end of the world anyway so now you're going to get this output but we see that we have all this body text all this body text is pretty crazy so in order to parse it you just have to look and see how it says right here this is what we're after and I know that it's 1.2 million as the number because I manually checks check this and I know that 1.2 million is what we're going after so I want this number right here right and so what we could do is we can request a formula in clay to give us everything after this text and before bounce and then it's GNA parse this for us so if we go and I mean obviously this worked because you saw it but so then if we go to traffic see how all we did is we said okay return the data between blah blah blah blah blah and bounce and then we got the data so then we're good to go now we put this into an AI generation where now we're estimating the revenue and I basically just gave it all the math look the conversion we think is this we have the estimated website traffic and blah blah blah and then I gave it all these examples and then I also gave it examples inside of clay as well of like me doing the math manually so that we could get it done and then I ran these numbers as well and they all looked pretty good so then now we have lines that we're ready to ship to another table and so in the table we're going to have contacts and we're just going to do a lookup so if there's multiple contacts we don't have to rerun the same thing um and waste money for that and I thought you all would appreciate this so this is how you can score companies by their General average order value and then turn that into a sentence you can put into a campaign\#\# Date Posted: 2024-11-30

\# 1 Tip to do When Your Cold Email Campaigns Aren't Working

hey everyone in this video we're going to talk about what is the Second Step that we like to take when we're working with customers in our agency if a cold email sequence isn't working what's the next step that we' like to take so if you are trying to figure out outbound marketing cold emails this video is for you if you feel like you've launched a campaign and then it just didn't stick um and if you don't know who we are uh my name is Eric I run a outbound agency called growth engine X we work with customers like instantly some publicly traded companies uh I think in I pulled the numbers July 31st we generated over 6,000 positive responses on behalf of our customers and we have about 40 right now between we fluctuate between 40 and 50 so I'm just saying we send 1.7 million cold emails a month I'm just saying that you know we do a lot of this and so uh I would say most emails follow a similar framework I I would think we could all agree with whether you you learn this framework from John Barrow s McKenna Jen Allen n uh will Al red will Atkin I feel like everybody's pretty much in agreement of this style of email and I don't even really consider myself a copywriter so I like go check them out they they are phenomenal copywriters go go check them out um the the the frame is usually subject line something that a colleague or a customer would have sent them first line the reason I'm reaching out to somebody uh whether it's AI generated or you just really refine your list uh the second line is something about like what you do or maybe some kind of poke the bear question Josh Brun talks about and then the third line is sharing some kind of case study or some kind of offer and then the fourth line is your call to action and so I I don't think there's anything wrong with that framework I love that framework it's it's a great framework um but but a lot of times it's just your starting place and so if that doesn't work with our customers they often will come to us and they say what's next and we always have a plan of what's next because that's what we need to do as an agency and what I always say is okay in an email we only have so many words I we're starting to not be afraid of sending longer emails but still you want to keep your email short you only have so many words we've presented this value proposition why are they not responding often times they're not responding because there is some kind of implicit OB ction that that email has brought up that now is probably keeping our response rates low that's one of the very first things that we get to it's not the only thing that we get to I made a whole video called part two uh hypothesis on message Market fit go find that I talk more about our process for finding message Market fit but I wanted to do a video specifically on this because our customers kept asking us about it and so implicitly there is an objection and so one of my favorite examples of this is we were sending emails on behalf of a tax accounting service where they help people save money on their taxes and we were saying oh my gosh we can help you save all this money on these taxes and we can help you with this and we can help you with that and and all these different things and we were kind of getting responses but it wasn't great and and we wanted to bring our response rates down and all these other things so then we shifted the campaign and I I was thinking to myself okay we're talking we're we're doing all the things hey you know tax season is coming up I wanted to reach out because I saw you've been in business for eight years I know you've got this plan out but if you need help this is how we can help then we got into it whatever and so then normal email but we're presenting this value proposition what is the objection that comes up when you receive a tax saving email I've already got this handled my accountant has already done it I don't really have a lot of time to dedicate to this we already have a tax plan whatever it might be the tax law hasn't changed that much since uh when Trump changed it so you know like how had why does my tax plan need to change right but I and so then we broke it down and we thought okay this value proposition is probably bringing up these objections how can we confront these objections inside of the email and so then we change things around and so then instead of saying hey we could help you save money on taxes I just helped another guy save I think their case study was they could help people that qualified save like over $30,000 on their taxes or something I did help this other person save $30,000 on their taxes pretty compelling case study um instead then we we would ask how do you know that your current accountant is using every legal loophole to get you as much back on taxes as possible and that works so well we even tried sending just that as the message with just a second line about case studies about how we could help and that worked even better and so one thing that we always again we always think about now is if you're sending that regular email nothing wrong with that email that should be your first test but if you're not getting responses to that email the first thing that we think about is what is the implicit objection that comes from this email and how could we handle it and could we handle it by using a poke the bear question go look up Josh brwn buy his course I think his course is phenomenal could we use a poke the bear question to make them think differently about the problem that's what I would say our example uses how do you know that and a lot of poke the bear questions start with how do you know so that's a good frame to be thinking of it through and so then um another thing you could do is in the PS line you could talk about it in the your offer you can talk by that objection and so if you've run outbound campaigns yourself before and you're looking for a the next step of what you should be doing because it hasn't worked that is one of the first things that we tell our customers is think about what is the objection that if you receive this email what's the first thing you're going to think and then how can we overcome that objection implicitly in our email and I know this was a shorter one but I hope it was helpful uh let me know in the comments if you found it helpful\#\# Date Posted:

\# Internal Onboarding process flow

hey everyone I wanted to make this video today because if you are looking to become a growth engine X customer you are another agency who follows us or you just followed the YouTube channel I think no matter what it is a skill for everybody to learn how to use no code tools and uh I just wanted to show this flow because it's maybe one of the favorite flows that I've ever created uh for my company and what this flow does is it automates a lot of the on boarding process that we have when a new customer comes in and so if you are evaluating becoming a customer of growth engine X you know this is an automation we've built for you to make sure that everything goes uh smoothly and if you're just learning no code tools it's also a great example of all the things that are possible so I'm just going to jump in and uh we we'll just you know get into it so the first thing that we have is just a trigger for a new task to be added inside of clickup and so what this does is we have a form that you fill out to become a customer of growth engine X and that form it automatically adds a new task to a space inside of clickup which this is what this mod this is looking for so we're just looking for a new task to be created so we could get the task ID and kick off the rest of the workflow this uh module right here called get a task all this is doing is it is uh grabbing all of the details so our onboarding form is actually kind of long and it grabs all of the details from the onboarding form form about like who we're targeting what your uh website is more content from the onboarding form uh as well and we just push all of it through here then this is a text parser uh which one does this oh this we actually need this text parser in order to create your um slack Channel and so that's all that's happening right here is if you put a space you need to replace that with a hyphen so that's all this text parser is doing then what this request is doing is it's creating a smartly client login I can't click into it because it'll show my API key and things like that but it's just creating your smart lead client login account so that we could give you access and send all of that stuff your way and you know just make it really really easy then we have uh my team is notified so this creates a message in our internal chat and it just notifies us that a customer filled out the form and you know here's a lot of content and details about them so that our whole team can get a notification that your onboarding form was filled out here we create a channel and in this channel this is where a lot of our client communication is going to be happening and so we create a channel here and uh you know just open up a slack connect Channel then in here we're editing click up with the smart lead client ID number so that we can do analytics going in the future based off of that client ID number and then we're also adding the slack ID number because one day I want to build automation so that we can um notify you AO automatically if you're a customer we can notify our customers automatically when tasks are done with them straight inside of slack and so I'm just building the foundation now for that to just make sure we have everybody's Channel IDs then we create another message and so th this is kind of funny the message that we create here um you'll see uh we put this is an automated reminder to send an invite to and then email so this email is coming from the onboarding form of the email of our customer and so the reason we have to put this in is you can't on unless I'm wrong you can't automatically invite people to a slack connect channel in make.com unless you have like slack Enterprise which I don't have and so all we do is just insert the email addresses here so that it you know we don't have to go searching in our like clickup or inside of our inbox and invite that it's just you just copy and paste that email and then you just invite the person uh so that's just taken care of right here oh boy then we have the login URL with this is everyone's login URL and then we create a password and all this stuff we and then we have a quick overview of how smart lead works so we want to make sure that everybody gets a demo from me about how um smart lead is working and so then we send this message straight in the slack channel so that we don't forget to be sending any of this stuff then I just invite my team the it's not slack connect so you can do it automatically um I wonder if it's like crazy yeah yeah no way to do it anyway then uh a big thing is we need to be able to buy domains on behalf of customers so we use AI to just generate domain ideas for them so they could see what it looks like and we could get approval pretty quickly we've actually found that most of the time the domains that we suggest are available so we don't you know use GoDaddy to check if the domains are available like doing an API call if we wanted to we could um but it's not the end of the world so then we just send 15 domain ideas that get outputed over here and then we send those in slack as well the other thing that gets sent in slack in this message is I also want to make sure that our check-in calls are automated uh as well so from the onboarding form customers can schedule their onboarding call and then um we have a 45 minute onboarding call and then when you're in slack I want to make sure that our first two calls are also scheduled on the books to because I just want to keep that communication going and then quite honestly I would have to open some actually I'll just pause hang on okay I was going to say I couldn't quite remember what this did uh but so what this does is it takes the information from your onboarding form and we are working on an AI messaging bot that we've built in clay so this just posts a web hook to Clay to kick off that bot and then we create a Google sheet of all of your analytics so that you don't have to check in smart lead for everything we can just check it straight in this analytics and then we add the sheet that was created over here into clickup and then we also add a row in our overall customer analytics sheet so that you can get so that we can keep track of your data this will give you this sheet um anytime you request it and because a lot of people just get away with just using smart lead but we have the sheet for our customers as well and then this is for our internal analytics where we track every single campaign on a 24-hour cycle and then we also roll that up to our clients so that we can see everything and um this is just a little bit of a way that we've automated our onboarding process with a lot of the normal tasks that every agency has to do and we just you know we do every time for our customers and we just want to put it on Rails and make sure it's all done for you so one you could trust that these things are going to happen but then two um you know our team can't forget to get these things done for you and there's checking calls placed in and things like that so um I hope this was either inspiring to you for what is possible with no code uh tools uh or if you're looking to become a customer this just gives a little bit of an under the hood about some internal things that we've built\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Make.com Tutorial Example Custom Tracking Workflow

in this video we're going to go over making a make.com workflow from complete scratch it's going to be a little bit more interesting than the workflows that we did uh in the previous videos and so in order the the problem that we're solving here is sometimes my team when they add email accounts to smart lead. they don't set a custom tracking because they just forget and it's just like an extra step that they forget to do and so I built a workflow that we're going to rebuild right now where um we list out all of the email accounts every Monday Wednesday and Friday and we automatically add the custom tracking domain to the email accounts and so then that way we never forget and we can just always do it automatically now I am going to be shooting this one a little bit from the hip so if I do a little bit of research you know just bear with me this is supposed to show you like exactly how I build these these workflows and so when you're thinking about these workflows the first thing you have to think about is like okay what's the first step of what I need and so this workflow is going to probably start with an API call to Smart lead. because the first thing that I need is like the list of email accounts that I need to add the custom tracking to so um we're just going to jump in here and we're going to put HTTP whoops and then we can make a basic off request and I already have my smart lead one um put in here but now we're just going to map a URL so we can just go to their documentation and I just want to look at like email list all email accounts per campaign that seems pretty good but I don't want the campaign ID whoops oh my gosh so their documentation I'm not scrolling right now and their documentation always does this let me uh let me just pause and find it on my own but I am just researching here to find it okay so I did find it and this is the URL that we're going to be using and I deleted my API key I'm going to add that back in after I paused the video but one thing I just wanted to show is that we don't need to have a body type because of the way that this API is being called and we don't need headers just by the way that this is being called um in make I don't know why they wouldn't just parse the response by default I just wanted to come here and say every time just parse the response because there's no reason to not parse the response and so just quick pause to put my AP I ke great so now we have this set up and we're just going to run this module to make sure that it's working properly so I'm just going to let it run and so we got all this back got to pause I don't know where my API key is going to be so good thing I paused because it is a little bit above but we got all of this data back of like all of these inboxes right and so the custom tracking domain is set on this one and I guess it's said on this one I thought I turned it off so I'm going to go in and I'm going to turn off one of the custom tracking domains so that we can see this work but we did get everything that we needed CU what we're really need is this inbox ID right here to keep moving on with uh the the API documentation and so the way I know that I'm so sorry I kind of skipped ahead because I couldn't because his like thing is scrolling so much the way you know that is because if you go to update email account see how this is the URL of the API key that we have to call but I need the email account ID so I needed to call this first to get a list of all of the inboxes that we have so I could have this email account ID and then I'm going to put it all in of like all of this data right here and so now we can uh push through okay so we're going to pin this one we're going to need it a little bit later and so now we're going to go to make and so the problem that we have here is like you could see from before hang on so the problem that we're going to have here is if all of your output come as separate bundles it'll automatically just feed all of that data through the workflow we need to set an iterator here because see how this is an array um if we were to just call this we would send the data absolutely nowhere because like it it's like literally a hundred of these email accounts and we can't move it through the workflow so when you have an array like this and you need to separate the array line by line you're going to use what called an iterator and so if you go to flow control and you hit iterator that's what you're going to be using here and so when we do the iterator again one mistake that I used to make was I would like uh I don't know I would do something crazy like I don't know I I forget what I would do wrong but um the way that you know that you're mapping this correctly is see how it says data array and and it says array here you want to just cop like drag and drop it over into here so that you can get the so then you can be separating the array if you pick the wrong one then it's it's not going to be working um okay and then this top thing is basically saying like hey this won't do anything unless you add another module which is uh precisely what we what we would need to do and so now uh we're going to take a quick pause sorry I had knocking on my door so now what we need to do is when we're setting the custom tracking domain right whoops update email account when we're setting the custom tracking domain we need the domain that we're actually setting and so in order to do that it's like all right so in this workflow how do we get the domain without doing anything crazy and so I know what the domain is because it's Ramesh 52.com auu is what we're doing here right right so each email obviously has the domain that we're using we need to separate it by this at symbol so we want all of the data after the at symbol so when we come in here we're going to use a text parser right now which is what we're going to need and then we are going to use a match pattern because we need a regular expression again and so we're going to ask chat GPT um how to do this and so we're going to open up trusty chat gbt and now we know the search pattern is a regular expression output groups are defined based on the expression for details see the module expression so this is fine we can we can go see the module expression but so we're going to search for a regular expression and so we're going to say give me a regular oh I'm going to use 3.5 so it's faster give me a regular expression that would return the data after the at symbol in Eric at growth engine gen x.com if this doesn't work we'll have it like crawl make.com um support docs great okay so we're going to take this and we're going to put this pattern in I'm just checking something we're going to put that pattern in and then the text that we're going to have it affect is going to be this from email so we'll put yeah we're going to put from now we'll put the username in that's fine so now we have this text parser so now we're separating everything now that we have this the text parser now we need to compose well now we need to like compose what we're doing here right and so what I mean by compose is now I'm separating this to have the domain but I need to have the custom tracking domain oh jeez I don't know why it does that I need to have this custom tracking domain as email tracking. golden boot.com right like I need it to get to into this format and so what we're going to do is I'm going to compose a string in make.com where it's I just use in in like in. golden boot.com so we're going to make this in Dot and then we'll just have the domain so the way we do that is we use a tool and we're going to compose a string rate bring it over here and now the text is going to be in Dot and then we're going to take our pattern over here and now we're going to be all set finally the original thing that we wanted to do is we wanted to update the email account and it keeps scrolling what the heck is wrong with that now we want to update the email account we're now ready to put this API call together as well so we're going to copy and paste this and we're going to make a new scen scenario and so we're going to say HTTP make a request URL we're going to put all this in now for the email account ID do not I'm this is the mistake I guess I was saying do not go to data and take the email account ID you want to use the flow control iterator to do that so now we have ID right here and then I'll enter my ID after we're done what what is this uh it's a post request so let's enter it as a post and now let's just check what else it wants us to do so there's no headers but it has this data here so we're just going to copy and paste this and we're going to go body type Json application and then request content Max emails per day actually I don't really want to update any of this I just want to delete all that because all I want to affect is just the the custom tracking domain um so then actually you know what yeah we'll uh I do like to have it with 50 so let me get my API key together all I'm basically basically going to do is I'm just deleting all of this and then with the custom tracking URL I'm literally just putting text in just right there and then I'll pause to put my API key in all right so now we're ready to give it a run we're going to come in here and I'm just going to turn it off so we have this one uh is turned off so now we have that and now we're going to let it run and if everything works Bang Bang now that was like definitely under 10 in my list so I'm just going to let it go to 10 boom okay so now that's stopped and then we come here now it's turned on it's all set we can check the status C name verified we're good to go in. send Greystone

\# Clay 101 Intro to Worfklows

so this is the clay.com interface I know I've got a lot of tables here and things like that so this is the clay.com interface where you're going to get started um building your workflows and things like that in this video in particular we're going to go over how to add data how to map an integration and then how to write formulas based off of those Integrations inside of the table with these basic steps you'll be able to build a lot of the things inside of clay it really just comes down to knowing the Integrations which we're going to get to later when we do overviews of Integrations and things like that so the first step is we need to add some data so we're going to hit new table most of the time when I'm building clay tables I'm mostly importing data from a CSV for the uh example here though we're going to find people from LinkedIn instead so we're just going to click on this and it's going to bring our browser here the filters work very much the same as you're used to we can filter for people only in in the United States and then we can filter for um president and so we could be looking for presidents in the United States and we could particularly look for something you know in their experience so maybe we'll find people who have had five experiences and they just became the president of the company so six months in the current role and they've had five experiences and so in this way clay helps us to do really deep level stuff that you can't do with other databases when you're building lists but we're going to go over that later so really quick we're just going to add data to a table so that we'd be able to use it so let's hit review people and it's just going to generate and now we're going to be able to check a preview of these people before we actually put them into a full clay table which sometimes takes a little bit great so there's 51,000 people who qualify for this which sounds more or less correct 50 out of 2500 people to in report so one thing I forgot is I'm going to limit these results because we don't need that many people so we're just going to hit 25 we'll just hit preview people again and so now once this loads what we're going to do is we're going to talk about how you can map this data so we're just going to hit import on this and now we've imported data into the um the table and so now you'll see that we have the job title their location the company domain and of course their LinkedIn profile because this is based off of LinkedIn data one thing that's missing is their full name and company name though so how are we going to get this well one functional part of clay is that these columns here are basically text columns URL columns number columns what you see is what you get with these columns whatever you see in these columns is the only thing that's in these columns uh with these columns this is an integration column and the way you know that it's an integration column is because there is a company logo over here whatever enrichment you're using over here here the company logo is going to show up and so what we're going to do right now is we just click into one of these Integrations see how all we see is Matthew bobsan but if you click into it we see all of these tokens now you might not want all of these tokens inside of your table which is why they keep it inside of this integration over here but if you wanted any of them you would be able to map it straight into your table and so see how if I hover over the tokens we see add as column over here so what we're going to do here is we're just going to click add as column and see how we already have a full name for this person we'll just map it there and even though we only clicked on Matthew we're going to get all of their first names I mean all of their full names into this column here now like I said we might want their first names so that we can write an email and say hi Matthew but we don't have a first name column uh already set up that's super easy we can hit add as column I want it to be titled first name so this is perfect and then we'll just hit create new column and now we have a new column created and I can move this over so I have full name first name job title all of these different things right and so now we have our uh you know our data inside of our table so now anytime you want to go from your data that you have now to new data you essentially need to enrich it right and so we're going to go to the top right over here and it's called enrich data where what we're going to do is we're going to use a data enrichment to find these people's email addresses and so um clay has a waterfall where you can just click on work email and it'll check these providers for you so it'll go to prospo first drop contact the tagma you can mix and match the order you could do whatever you'd like um the great part about this is you only get charged clay credits when an email address is found so if you have it if the email address has not been found you're not going to get charged so a lot of times people are saying you know oh is the data inside of clay good I don't know what do you think of dagma what do you think of drop contact what do you think of Hunter what do you think of this is find email um what do you think of prosio you know like what do you think of snav what do you think of Apollo remember Clay is the workflow tool the only data that clay really like has that it's giving to you is this LinkedIn data maybe but even that that's a mix of Partners who are bringing them that data Clay is the workf float tool so anytime you have questions about the data Integrity of clay don't question clay question the enrichments that you're using so you could do this waterfall here um not many of these people well actually enough of them have company domains let's do the waterfall so now we'll set up the waterfall it's super easy we just map their full name and then we just map the company domain so now we've set up our inputs this is essentially how you set up every integration every integration has a certain amount of information that it needs in order to work how are we going to find these people's email addresses if we don't even know their name and we don't even know what domain we're looking for so so then we have a validation provider that's already set up for us here that's super easy and now we can go we're going to we could hit save and run first 10 rows here but what I'm going to do is I'm going to kill two birds with one stone here we're setting up our integration we would let this run it's going to find email addresses for us and only charge us when it finds email addresses if we click run settings down here we can uh turn on and off auto update so if you're setting up your table and you don't want this column to automatically run which we're going to get into later you can turn on and off auto update but then you have this conditional formula here and so what the conditional formula allows us to do is only run this column if certain criteria is met now we're going to get into this in later videos but this is the major way that you save credit costs inside of clay because say if um a person doesn't meet your lead criteria because they're not actually like say they are a vice president and they got brought in because I didn't exclude vice president and it's just a a match search here right so vice presidents don't match my search so I don't actually want to run Integrations against these people because this person doesn't actually fit my criteria so I don't want to pay for their email address so I'm going to go to conditional formula I'm going to hit use Ai and I'm just going to say if and then see how type um backslash to insert column so we're going to say if and then we're going to say job title contains Vice do not run this column because otherwise I'm good to run this column I'll hit generate formula and now we're going to go so seeing how we get this output here so we have President Market president co-president president co-president vice ah no it's not going to run no it's not going to run any other situation it is going to run now see how we have Market here that's such an edge case I'm I'm I wasn't covering for it but we could put if job title contains Vice or Market do not run this column and then we would edit it very quickly and now we're not going to run it off of this so we'll hit output is correct save formula and now this is how you run a conditional formula inside of clay so now we can hit save and run first 10 rows and now it's going to automatically add all of the enrichment columns for these uh companies right and so it says missing input because it's missing the company domain we could just a little hack with Clay it's not even a hack this is just drop contact and this is just example of how you need to know how to use clay but then you also need to know how to use every other um you also need to know how to use every other um integration inside of clay right and so if the company domain is missing drop contact allows us to do an enrichment by a LinkedIn profile so I can just drop in there and then hit save and run these rows and now we can be using their LinkedIn profile as a point of enrichment instead of just the name and Company domain don't mean to confuse you here this is all just to show you hey you know there's multiple ways to to get this done and so we found the email address here and I think we just need to run these things again um whoops so we said great we found some email addresses here and now they're moving over and so these are all missing inputs we won't be able to do that let's see so it's missing the input for the domain let's find one see how the valid email wasn't found and we have a domain over here so we didn't get charged for that so then we move on to enrich person from drop contact and we're going to see if we get a domain here okay so we got a domain so now we get run condition not met on the rest of these right let's see where drop contact doesn't get us a person though okay so here is an example where drop contact they have the person in their database but they don't have an email address so then it tries dagma dagma didn't have it so now it's going to go to find email and then a find email doesn't have it's going to try Hunter and we were not charged the entire time as we go across this path so when you're asking for waterfall data enrichment we're trying one two three four five providers and we could add more all in one shot and we're not being charged when we find uh when we don't find email addresses and so finally the last thing that I think everybody needs to know when you're first starting off with Clay is you can also write formulas over here and so formulas work the same way as conditional formulas just the formulas I use them to basically write if then statements inside of clay and so um the conditional formulas are if then statements but only for an integration this formula I use it a lot for like um if validated work email is not empty output purple if validated work email is empty output orange and so essentially what we'd be trying to get here is if it's you know if it's if we have a validated work email we're going to get purple and if we don't we're going to get orange which then you can get that we can hit output is correct and then you could see this formula got filled out so at a base level clay might still seem intimidating but now you have all of the um tools that you need in order to start interacting with it in the next video we're going to do a deep dive onto sources and the different ways that I use the sources and then in the next video after that we're going to go over a deep dive into the enrichments and the different use cases that I see with each of those enrichments so that you can know your way around the platform a lot more but for people who just want to get started you can now go forth and prosper\#\# Date Posted: 2023-03-01

\# Build Target Contact Lists based on Zip Codes

so in this video we're going to go over how can you find a company how can you find Targets of people who are near a specific company using the Apollo filters and so this is great for if you if some kind of event happened at one facility and you want to Target other people that it happened at there it happened at a nearby organization and you want to Target those people and say hey this happened like right in your back door how would you you know you should be worried about this or something like that so in this case what we're doing is we're looking for cyber breaches that happened in a specific location and then reaching out to an ideal customer profile who is near that cyber breach so the way we do that is we pick one of the companies that had a cyber breach so this company had a cyber breach uh in the past and they're in Grand Rapids Michigan so what we'd have to do is we'd have to just search Grand Rapids Michigan and then we can get the zip code and so we're going to go with probably we'll just stick with 49501\. so now if we go to people we can search if you go to location we can search by a zip radius and then we're going to say I already forgot it four nine five zero one four nine five zero one and we're going to say within 25 miles we're going to keep this super super tight we have a long list of companies that this fits for so we're going to keep it pretty tight So 49501 within 25 miles now this only will look for new people not saved people I don't know why it does that but that's just the way Apollo wants to run the ship and that's what we have to deal with so now there are 32 people who fit this criteria but that's totally fine because these 32 people we have something extremely extremely relevant to be able to say to them and we're just going to move on to the next one so we'll put together a couple of lists like this that are that they had they are a law office that had a cyber security breach grab all 32 of these people and say hey somebody in your backyard in Grand Rapids Michigan that they've probably heard of as well they've probably heard of Warner Norcross um then we'll be able to reach out to them the only thing left to do is we just want to hit wnj.com and then we want to go to company and we want to hit include exclude list of company and then we want to exclude this company because of course they were part of the cyber security brief we don't need to remind them of their or cyber security habits uh and so that is how you would put together a list of companies that they are near some other kind of sugar event that you want to put out this could work if there is going to be an event okay there's going to be an event in Miami and you want to reach out to companies that could possibly be there and you want them to attend another great way to do this without going crazy and entering every single town in Miami you don't have to enter Miami Aventura Brickell uh West Palm Fort Lauderdale you can just use the the uh ZIP code search here and get your targeting done that way uh and as always\#\# Date Posted: 2024-04-01

\# Lead Scoring in Clay

because uh I don't think people really know that account scoring and contact scoring inside of clay is ridiculously easy and a lot of times extremely cost-effective for what you want to be able to do and so we're actually going to start rolling out accountant contact scoring for all of our customers um for their entire Tam for free and so uh this is basically the way that it happened we set this up for one of our customers and so you could see the only input we need to make this work is the company name website company LinkedIn and really we just need the website and be LinkedIn so we can pull lists from Apollo clay ocean harmonic wherever we get the lists from we would be able to make this work and then they all get scored from here and so we're just going to skip over some stuff and so for instance they really need to make sure that it is Gen genuinely a construction company so we have the company description we have the keywords and then we have their SEO description over here we're checking if they're hiring for any uh jobs and we're seeing if they have any pertinent roles on their team as well then what we did is we stacked all of the keywords from the description the SEO description the uh keywords from Apollo or the keywords from Ocean and they we're also doing Google searches with this API over here this is called server. we're doing Google searches to see if they mention any really good keywords uh on their website as well and those keywords would opt them in and say that they are a higher value account for them and uh we just created the Google searches over here and that stuff and then uh we ran that and we basically get a scoring algorithm that we we're doing company headcount growth over here too and so then the way that the scoring works is we could basically jump in here and we can assign different scores for different Industries so I'm going to take a minute and explain how this part works so for you can pick as many scoring criteria you want well I guess up to 15 but then you can just have another column so it's fine as then you're going to score your value so here we're scoring just industry and then we want the industry to contain a certain keyword so either it contains it it equals it or it's between because it's a number right and so uh we have construction highway equipment rental services Environmental Services all these inputs these inputs pair with the scores down here and so the way we do this easily is we make a Google sheet and we put all of the keywords that we want to be scoring by and we put all of them in a Google sheet and then we put the scores right next to it so that way we'll literally say construction 50 Highway 50 equipment rental services 50 Environmental Services 10 and it's all in a Google sheet then I'll copy the uh Industries and then I'll ask chat to put it into a comma separated list so we can just copy and paste it straight in here and then I'll take all the numbers and ask it to put in a comma separated list so it's not too hard to just literally go construction 50 Highway 50 because if we wanted to make an edit right now we would have to do our counting and I would add something here and then it work backwards and I would say like because whatever key value you have in here is the way that's it's going to get scored and we have our scoring criteria for their Tech stack we have their scoring criteria for their employee growth over time and this is how like the between work so if it's between 40 and 100 we're going to get 25 if it's between 20 and 40 we're going to get 10 if it's between five and 20 we're going to get five all those things so then um anyway that's how we got that working and then before I show you the next thing you could also add subtractions too so if somebody has their headcount to be between one and 100 and they don't contain a rental keyword because we're looking for construction keywords in this one if they're between one and 100 we're going to give them negative 100 so even if they're qualifying for all the other things we're just going to really kill their lead score because um you know they're just outside of the headcount range and so we just don't want them so then even though they got a score of 50 they'll get a negative 100 over here and then they'll basically get a zero and so then we could prioritize them correctly then we run a different one for rental keywords over here and then we just have another one of just like a really Topline fit to just make sure that we're really nailing that one and so uh clay makes this like I said ridiculously easy to do I think there's products out there that are charging thousands of dollars a year to do lead scoring and you could do all of it inside of clay and it's ridiculously easy oh and then the next feature that they have is then you can click on the score and you can see why it got scored its way so we're saying it's saying 2149 is between 20 and 40 so it got 10 points so that's their head count of growth increase over the past year and then F FR equals keyword F FR so that's that their country headquarters is in France so they got 25 points right and then we can go down here and we see oh 66 is between one and 100 so now we got negative 100 points right or we'll go here and this is a great fit company and we see why is it great key up because there's constructions uh in our keyword column their growth is high and then they're in France boom but then we also know where did that one go then we can also look at this and see oh my gosh 31 is between 1 and a th000 this is for how many times they mention a construction type keyword which is over here see how many times they mentioned a construction type keyword and then 13 is between one and a thousand so that's anytime they mention a non-construction type keyword it's a lesser value keyword but it's still a good keyword so we give them a 50 so then we could really really give them a great score then all we have to do is just make a formula in clay and just combine all of them together and then we can get our our total lead score so it would just be um add and then we'll just go to our lead score columns and we'll just say score row and Clay score and score and and then a quick little tip for you to keep track of which ones you've already used if you've already used one it'll gray it out so see how we that's grayed out because we've already used it so we'll just hit score and we'll hit score one more time and then we got score so we've got all of our scores here we'll hit generate formula and then we'll be able to get an output over here for our lead scoring so like 355 is a really really really great customer for them right 305 is really really great so now we can just draw a line we could just say okay you know this is the line of everybody that we're going to be reaching out to let's go find contacts and then we can score contacts the same exact way like and we can score like a fleet manager is going to have a higher score than an operations manager something like that and so uh yeah I hope you find this useful the lead scoring is something I feel like people want to do all the time and they over complicate it clay can just take care of all of it for you\#\# Date Posted: 2024-04-01

\# Building Cannabis Professional Lists for Cold Email

this is going to be a pretty simple video where I just go over how we're going to build a list of basically every cannabis professional that we possibly can for a friend of mine and without further Ado we just hop straight into the video the mission that we've accepted is to try to find any person who basically has anything to do with cannabis uh basically on the east coast of the United States that part we're going to unless the list gets gigantic we're going to probably leave that part out but so uh we'll be looking for CEOs and Founders and those types of people but we want to basically find any person associated with cannabis so we can do this uh we're going to use clay to do this we're going to use Apollo to do this and we're going to use sales navigator to do this to just get as much you know coverage as we possibly can and then we would probably combine it all and DD against the LinkedIn profile so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to actually find companies from LinkedIn and we are going to let's see here United so United States is fine I know I said East Coast that's something that honestly is easier to filter out in sheets uh if it's not costing us money to do anything here so we're just going to attack the description keywords more than anything else so we're GNA say uh cannabis I have never even had alcohol in my life so now I'm having a brain fart about what we should else we should put here to be honest I'm not even sure if I know how to spell \[Music\] marijuana see I'm an idiot okay so I'll put this in marijuana \[Music\] CBD hang on all right I literally just asked chat gbt to just make sure I wasn't missing anything because uh I just jumped straight into this video but I just thought about how I don't know that much so the only thing we're going to do here those we're just going to exclude nonprofit uh organizations just because we don't want to do that and we don't want government as well like we don't need like the lobbyists and and all of those things and we are just going to see basically yep we're just going to see what this gets us at this point so run this cool so 14,000 companies awesome I don't really want marketing services and I don't want recruiting so we're going to get rid of that and then recruiting we don't want recruiting cool so then we'll go this way so we got our company we have our company list here didn't knock things off that much so we're going to import these and we won't enrich it because I'm going to send this to them uh as a sample to just see if they want it so we will reach out to we got this list so we're just going to name it cannabis company table sample and then we're going to do the same thing but now we're going to do it on people as well and this one gets a little bit more fun so we're going to hit the United States and then we are going to put uh same thing job titles just CEO founder owner president we're going to exclude Vice because it's going to get crazy when we put this so we're not going to include like \[Music\] assistant intern all those things CEO founder oh yeah chief executive those are the ones that I think we should cover right now and then we'll go back and we'll run this if we need anything else so now we need to find if they have anything to do with cannabis well there's a couple things we're going to do to clean it up as well number of followers we want to find people like if you have less than well in the Cannabis industry we're going to say they have to have at least 50 connections because if they don't have 50 connections it might not be a real LinkedIn profile so that's just another thing we want to cover for and now in order to find people who have something to do with cannabis we can either search their bio so we can find keywords in the headline keywords in they're about or we can search their experience we could technically do both but I think the broader one that people are going to do is they're going to mention something about cannabis in their about section if they're going to mention anything at all oh I keep forgetting I guess you don't spell marijuana with a u okay cool limit results we're not going to limit it education all these things we don't really need now if this list is way too big we're going to start focusing on just east coast States uh but for right now we'll just let it rip because we could filter that out later uh you know what it's super easy we can also just go to chat chbt and just ask it can you make a comma separated list of east coast states for me to copy and paste somewhere else all right so then we go back to Clay see what we're working with here so not much we're going to wait for this to get done see how crazy it is and then I'm just going to move as well into yeah I was going to say I do this all the time okay cool so we have this that we're going to use and then I just wanted to show while Clay is loading oh it already loaded all right so we've got 4,000 people here that's cool we have another way that we're going to get everybody else so we're just going to grab this we don't need to enrich anything else just yet now while this is loading we also have put together a little bit of a list inside of Apollo as well and I put Mary Jane because I just figured you know why not and so we will change this location to the United States this looks pretty good so we have almost everyone in this list already saved I'm just going to show everyone a little trick we've been using Lately from our friend Jesse over at lead magic where they have their own database and they you know every Apollo URL is basically the same structure and they have their own database where they can convert this so we're just going to upload this and we're going to say that we want I think there was 10,000 leads on here oh so we want 8,000 leads right and we're going to say list for Vents and then we're going to let it run so then we'll hit submit and then we're going to get access to this list over here then we've got our clay list here where we're going to say cannabis list for Vince and we've got everything over here as well wow the MMJ fund made a person that's very interesting that's why I see that's why we put that that connections count in there because to stop it from really really garbage profiles like that but anyway we've got that rolling for us as well so we found we used clay to find as many people as we could we used Apollo to find as many people as we could now the best place that we're going to go to find truly as many people as we can is going to be sales Navigator so we have 37,000 people Which is far more than anything else that we've been looking at before and so what we've done is we created a search where we're looking for the founder owner CEO chief executive or the president and we're looking for anybody who has cannabis or CBD or marijuana on their profile and so I wonder why this person came up we would have to visit their profile and see why so sound body Sports Rehab that makes sense this is a real estate guy I wonder why this guy came up too sometimes sales Navigator is crazy license owner in the Cannabis industry okay psychiatric and addiction medicine okay we don't want to reach out to this person um so we're then going to say not addiction do we get rid of this guy I could have sworn that this worked in a bullion maybe it's actually minus see if we got rid of this guy we did not get rid of him we might have to enrich this with clay and get rid of them there interesting but so then now what we're going to do is we have this whole LinkedIn search right so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to be way better about our States because we don't want to pull the entire thing right oh whoops so I'm actually going to pause the video while I type in all these states we' got these states and we've got 6,000 people here that we're going to be pulling that fit these states and so the way we're actually going to be pulling this list is we're going to break this list into three different pieces so sales Navigator only gives you access to the first 100 lists and there's 25 people on each list so they only give you access to the first5 200 people in a list we need to split this so that we can pull the entire thing so what we're going to do is we're going to split by company headcount because the company headcount doesn't matter to us to to us here so we have one to 10 we've got 2K people so we're going to take this we're going to go to Clay and we're going to say hey I want you to pull this for me find people from sales Navigator URL great and we're going to pull this one now it's going to go to a new blank table it's going to create the source now this is going to take a couple of minutes to run so we're just going to leave this B we're going to rename it cannabis list for Vince great so now we're gonna pull this oh but we're going to move on to the next one sorry so we're going to hit this uh import nope what are we doing here find people from sales Navigator URL we're just going to do it again so now we used 1 to 10 already we're going to now use 11 of 50 but see how 11 of 50 has 1K in it we've got more space so let's keep adding until we get close to that 2.5k cool so I'm cool with just pulling this and then we will put this in and honestly I could stop here just because this is going to get mostly everything that we need but um we're just going to do it one more time to just get every single profile that we could possibly get so now we'll do self-employed 5,000 to 10,000 and then we'll kill the rest of them and this should be like, 1500 nice so now we'll grab this and let this run and so now we've used three different data sources in order to pull all the different ones I'm not going to show in this video how we're going to combine them all together dup them and um enrich them because that's just going to take I I have to wait for everything to load and it's just going to take too much time but essentially we're going to export everything to Google Sheets and then in Google Sheets we'll just be basically duping based off of LinkedIn profile URLs we're going to throw back in clay find some emails and then have a list for hopefully a happy friend so yeah I hope you enjoy this video a little bit basic but uh hope it gives you an idea of how you can build like really large lists um and how each provider has their own strengths for what they're grabbing for you\#\# Date Posted: 2023-03-01

hey so in this video we're going to go over how you can spy on your competitors connections and grab the people that are your ideal customer profile that your competitor has already connected with and uh at the end of the video we're going to talk about how you can put this a little on autopilot so there's actually two ways to get this done the first way to get this done is if your connection has all of their connections public you'll see this 500 plus connections here and what you could actually do is now you see all of their connections in this uh format and then you can further search for more filters which it's not as good as sales Navigator but it is still pretty good if you go to all filters and then you can add their location what do they talk about their current company uh those different kinds of things and then basically what you really want is the title though and so I can look at Max's connections on LinkedIn basic and I could spy on all the other CEOs that he has connected with on LinkedIn and if you uh want you could even scrape this out with things like Phantom Buster and different things like that uh and we'll talk about that at the end of the video so this is the way to do it on LinkedIn basic the way to do this on a sales Navigator is if we were to just open up sales Navigator and we just need to switch the tab here we go and now we are on sales Navigator and so if we were to go to this awesome button down here connections of we're going to jump in Max Mitchum because we're connected uh then it will give me up to a thousand results so it's not everybody but it's still pretty dang good but you can use all of your sales Navigator functions to scan their connections as well and look for you know CEOs that that they're connecting with in the you know internet come on industry okay be able to go computer software load and so there you know we got the industry to load and you can use this to find anybody uh by any sales Navigator that's in their connections now LinkedIn unfortunately doesn't give you ultimate access to the connection so here's my actual favorite way to use it is we combine this with Phantom Buster and what we'll do is we'll create this search for multiple connections of people that we kind of want to spy on and then we'll use Phantom Buster and we'll set up Phantom Buster to uh run this every week and any new person who is added to this we know that they just recently connected with them and they're probably trying to prospect into the account and you know that means that if they're trying to prospect his account we should probably be trying to prospect into the account as well this works for not only just your you know the CEOs of your connection well the CEOs of your competitors Target their sales people their sdrs you know anybody who's doing those kinds of sales activities and constantly connecting with new people and so very quickly this is a quick overview of how you do that on Phantom Buster you would just go to your Phantoms and either we would use LinkedIn search export or then we would use the sales Navigator uh LinkedIn search export sales Navigator search export literally just throw those searches into the uh the search field and then you'd be ready to rock and roll uh and of course then you could use other enrichment tools like clay or uh you know hunter.io contact out de tagma those different ones to be able to enrich all of the profiles that you just got and then you know go on and do some prospecting so I hope you found this video to be helpful and if you did let me know and I can make some more videos\#\# Date Posted: 2024-10-01

\# Looking for People Who Used to Work at Your Current Customers

hey everyone here's another workflow that we will get asked about often enough that I wanted to create a video for it so that we could go over how we can put it together and things like that so in this video we're going to go over what if you have a list of 2,000 customers or whatever it might be you have this list of customers and what you want to do is you want to see who in your target market today had a past experience of working at one of your customers and then you want to message them about it because in my opinion one of the best messages that you could send is e even if that person didn't even have anything to do with your company to be able to say Hey you used to have an experience of working at one of these companies they're one of our customers right now I think so the first thing we need to do is we need to just get your list of customers together so this is just a fake list of customers that we just put together I highly recommend using the workbook function in clay because it's just going to keep everything really really really organized and so um we're going to have just this is just a fake list of customers over here and so then we're going to take our ICP list and we're just going to upload it so I just took a list from Apollo and we just uploaded it into this clay table and so now what we need to be able to do is we need to be able to list out all of the past company experience that these folks have had if you want to make this a little bit maybe more direct you don't have to list out all the past experience that somebody had you could just list out the most recent experience instead whichever one that you'd want to do it's a little bit easier to do the most recent experience so I'm not going to go over that I'm going to go over all of the experience so now what we need to be able to do is we have these people they fit our ICP anyway no matter what we're going to email them we're going to send them some kind of email but we want to check do they have some kind of uh past company experience that we're looking for again so we can send a message that's like you know if I used to work at HubSpot and now I work at Salesforce then somebody who has a customer with HubSpot they could say hey hubspot's one of our customers I saw you used to work there in the past now you're working at Salesforce I think we could help you too basically what we're going for here right so now we upload this and then again we're just going to filter and we're going to look for anything that is not their current experience and we're going to use write the table over here to just write all of the past experience of these people to another table which that's going to look like this over here and so as you can see we've just written everybody's past experience over to this table and then what we're doing is we're doing a lookup on that table now this is taking forever before the video I accidentally hit recq so we'll see if it loads but everything you'll still be able to visualize everything so then what it's doing is it's looking up from this table it's looking up in the fake list of customers is there a domain that's similar and so you always want to normalize the URLs we normalize them over here and you want to use an exact match search so it will take ww. uber.com and just turn it to uber.com as well as taking anything over here and just forcing it to get normalized as well too and so then what we'll do is we'll do a lookup and then it we'll fill in this field here of a confirmation of there being a lookup which then we can go enrich this well we don't actually have to enrich this person we're going to write I just put that in here then we can write this to another table in order to continue our workflow again this is a little Frozen and I'm just running out of time in the day to be able to to do this but so essentially this is how this workflow works again step one take a list of your customers and normalize their URLs step two upload your list of people you're going to email anyway and enrich them so that you can get all of their past uh company experiences push those to a new table so you can use your lookup record now we do have an Enterprise clay account I don't know where Auto delete is on their product features so I do apologize you do want to turn on auto delete because I only need to find this instantaneously if we run this up past 50,000 rows it's going to be crazy and it's not going to work anymore so we want it this is basically going to run I mean it's not running instantaneously right now but when it loads it will and so then we'll get that confirmation right there and then we'll be able to instantly take that data and then just push it to the next part of our workflow where we'll validate the email and do whatever else we're going to do write our messaging and all those things push it to Smart leader instantly and it's all going to get taken care of over there and so again this is something that you can use clay for that yes you could use sales navigator for something like this as well too I found it to not be the most accurate and it's pretty tedious to add a bunch of past company experiences to the sales Navigator URL um you could deconstruct the sales Navigator URL and try to add it that way which would work too but uh that's just a whole other video to probably talk about and so I thought this would be interesting for people to see how you could do it again I know I talk fast just last time step one take your fake list of customers step two upload your ICP list and get all of their past company experience mapped out and written to a different table so that you can do a look up and see if any of the domains match your fake list of customer customers and then push those to the next part of your workflow so you can validate emails and do all those kinds of things and so I hope this was helpful and uh thanks for watching let me know if you have any questions oh and if you want this template I'll try to share the template but if if there's nothing shared as a template let's see this I'm just not sure if I share this if it's going to be the whole workbook or something and you really need the whole workbook tied together so I'm not sure if it's really worth sharing so if there's no share then it's not really worth sharing you're going to have to build it yourself so I apologize about that but it's super easy with filter list objects and everything so as always thanks for watching\#\# Date Posted:

\# Reach Out to Job Changers Automatically

hey so in this video what we're going to go over is how can you use clay to extract your first level connections who all recently got new jobs and then do something with that information uh and it's actually uh pretty simple and a lot of fun to put together and so the three things that you'll need is a clay account a sales Navigator account and a phantom Buster account and between those three things we can integrate them pretty easily to get everything that you would need uh to run this play so the first thing that we would need to do is first we're going to go to sales Navigator and we are going to set up our sales Navigator search which this is super super easy so the first thing you're going to do is just go to connection and add your first degree connections so that you only are searching for people that you are directly connected with and then what you're going to do is go to spotlights and you're going to hit activities and shared experiences there's going to be one name to change jobs in the last 90 days this is what we're after so now it'll create your search for you and uh we see we have 1.5 uh K results this is pretty good uh we're going to run this once and it's going to take everybody and then every time we run it after that it's only going to add new people to the uh to the list so uh one time we'll get everything and then as it goes it's going to be super super updated so I do want to point something out here that sometimes even though we say change jobs in the last 90 days uh see Josh Norris at lavender five months of the roll five months in the company he did something else on his profile that changed his jobs in the the last two months he didn't necessarily get a new role so sometimes there's some uh some interesting things like Jennifer here six months in a row six months in company so odd that it puts it in there but let's go and check out started a new role at partnership leaders two months ago okay um so there is some role but director of Partnerships at Apollo is her current role and she definitely did not change that uh two months ago it's six months ago but this is what LinkedIn gives us and we could filter out more information in clay so now what we're going to do is we're going to set up our sales Navigator uh Phantom Buster run so you'll see I have the Phantom Buster uh uh Phantom sales Navigator search export which is going to be the one that we're going to be needing to use so we're going to connect our LinkedIn cookie and so now we're connected to LinkedIn and now we're going to input that search URL we don't need multiple search URLs we're just going to use one we input that search URL and we're going to scrape a number of results to scrape for launch 2500 is fine the first time you launch this is going to be the only time that it actually scrapes that many we're going to put it on Watcher mode as well so make sure you hit advanced settings and put on Watcher mode and watch this Watcher mode it's going to reprocess that same URL and it will uh not include any of the profiles that we've already included in the past uh that got new roles so then we're going to hit save and now one thing I also want to point out is you should launch this manually one time so that you get the entire result and then come back in and put it on repeatedly uh no repeatedly Advanced and uh what you can do here is basically say like I want this to run only every Monday and if you do that you'll get it to run once per week and you'll get all the new people who uh have gotten new jobs and then we'll hit save and now that Phantom is set up so like I said you should launch that manually the first time and so we got some profiles here uh launch that manually so that uh you're kind of in control of the process it can kind of get yourself set up uh from the beginning and so I pulled those Phantom Buster records into our clay table and so the way that I did that was if you add your Source uh as Phantom Buster and you connect your Phantom Buster account you can get your API key from your work workspace settings and you see our inputs as we just pulled in the agent ID and it auto populated all of this information and so we were able to get the person's name their title how long have they been in the role how long have they been in the company their profile URL uh which actually we can't even use this because the sales Navigator URL uh which so then we used enrich person from search and we just entered their name and their company name and we were able to connect all of these profiles with somebody um and then we were able to get the company URL uh from this actually was from the Phantom Buster search so you see Phantom Buster regular company URL which then easily got us the domain which then we were able to find their work email and then I extrapolated their LinkedIn URL as well so in this flow what I'm doing is I took their email and I updated my HubSpot uh to automatically create new contacts that match this criteria what you could also do is uh you could also set up Phantom Buster to send a message to these people automatically when they change these jobs uh so lots of different ways that you can slice this but this is one of my favorites to to put together for sure\#\# Date Posted: 2024-08-01

\# Qualifying Companies for Fit with 40-mini

I think we all know the feeling that when we are doing company level searches or even person level searches uh sometimes the databases don't give us enough to work with in order to really refine our list and now with the onset of GPT 40 mini I think now ai is cheap enough that you're able to uh use AI to review every company that you want to reach out to for having a proper fit and I'm going to show you a quick little workflow that we created in order to do this but I think we're all familiar with if you're doing a search and you're using a tool like Apollo or clay or whatever it might be a lot of times the search filters that you can use are the Industries on the company's LinkedIn profile and a lot of times these are self-reported Industries so one the people who are filling out the industries don't really care about what they're actually filling out and two sometimes they think of themselves as being a particular industry but they're not actually in that industry so a lot of times SAS companies that are in the real estate industry will say that they are a real estate uh company but that's not true because they're a real estate SAS company or a consulting firm that works in the SAS business will say that they're a SAS company but they're not or they're they'll say they're a computer software company but they're not actually one of those companies and so the pro and a lot of times people will blame the databases for getting these things wrong but it's not the database's fault at all because the way that you look at a company for having right fit might not be the way that another person looks at the company so if they build it for your use case they might be uh being exclusive to other people and the way that they want things done but now with 40 mini being so cheap now we can train AI on exactly what kind of companies we're looking for and then for an extremely extremely low cost we can have ai make the decision if it's a right fit company or a bad fit company as well so now we can do our filtering do as much as you want whether you're using clay to filter down your list Apollo to filter down your list I crunch Bas Zoom info whatever you're using now it's cheap that you can get AI to do it and I'll show you the prompt right now and so this is a quick workflow that I put together I was actually using GPT 40 in order to put this together and then when 40 mini came out I just thought to myself oh my gosh this is gonna be so much better we should just use 40 mini and so you could see we have this column called Outreach decision here and it gave us an output and look at that cost 0.000000 three cents per call really really really cheap and it's making decisions for us if we should reach out to these companies now I'm reaching out to a list of companies that's completely random and or I uploaded a list of companies that's completely random and so we're actually going to get a lot more NOS than I thought we would get but basically what happens here is oh that wasn't even four that wasn't even 40 mini or maybe it was see Clay is giving me some problems today but anyway our prompt that we want to be using here is we're saying hey using the inputs determin if we should reach out to the company or not respond with just yes or no in your output this is the information about our company and who we sell to and I generated this company summary in a different table but you could just input what your company does and input as much information as you want about who you sell to and exactly the kind of company that you're looking for because then you can say this is the information about the company we're reaching out to I only put the description in because I'm just trying to play with this but you could also put in their employee headcount their location any other data that you might want to put in there and now you can have ai make the decision if you should be reaching out or not the next level and again super super super cheap the next level that you can do and maybe what I would more suggest I'm just Clay is just working slow for me today so I I couldn't get 40 mini to run these for us what you can also do is you can give the inputs and say hey on a scale of 1 to 10 tell me how How likely we should be reaching out to these companies so we're basically saying hey rate this company on a scale of 1 to 10 one being a company is not a fit for our Outreach and 10 being it's a perfect fit and we should reach out to them then I give our company summary as an input this is just an example I'm building for a friend and then we have the description of the company and then we have you know a bigger prompt of you know sometimes the industries can be ambiguous so don't rate it as harshly we have this review as we're a VP of sale and like all of this other stuff that we put in here and you could pause the video if you want to check out these prompts a little bit more that's the whole prompt if you want to pause the video and then I'll get this whole prompt brought up too but anyway we can run this now and even with this longer prompt which Clay is giving me a little bit of some problems today but anyway see how this cost a penny with GPT 40 but then with 40 mini it's far far cheaper so it's going to be more expensive obviously than this you know 0.00004 but it's going to still be ridiculously cheap and so I hope you get some ideas I I don't think this is something that I'm ever going to post about and publicly say like this is the workflow because everyone has a different Outreach criteria and I don't think the prompt would be the same every single time but hopefully you could use this where if you have an industry that's tough to reach you can put all the inputs in and then use 40 mini to just take a look at the search and uh or take a look at your inputs of the company and it can make a decision and so then we could hopefully refine our Outreach so that we're not reaching out to uh bad fit companies and then having them Mark us a Spam now instead we could be reaching on only to goodfit companies and then the advantage you get for rating them from one to 10 is even if AI gets it a little wrong you could still say okay let's reach out to every company above a five or if you want to be super particular let's reach out to every company above an eight right so uh anyway I hope this gives you some ideas I don't think we'll produce the prompt publicly because I don't think it would be useful to people um this is definitely something that if you pause the video and you can make your own prompts you know make your own prompt and just use this idea to help power your Outreach this is this is definitely something that on an individual company level you should be creating for yourself\#\# Date Posted: 2025-02-01

some of you might recognize this doc from the clay graduation workflow uh but this is actually a campaign that we actually launched for somebody and I think this campaign is really really interesting because it flies in the face of conventional wisdom and so what I mean by that is there is a lot of people who even on my own YouTube channel who say personalization is meaningless relevance is everything and I like to think in a hierarchy of of course if you have something relevant to say you should say that relevant thing and if you have nothing better to say then you should personalize and so for everybody who doesn't know what I mean let catch it up if you personalize an email usually what you're talking about is hey I saw you went to ruter do you ever get to go back there and so you just personalized it with something that has nothing to do with your offer but if you said hey I saw you're using uh type dream to build your website and you also have rb2 be installed are you know do you ever find that their the integration between the two is very clunky which isn't even a true statement but anyway it you could that would be relevant to say hey this integration is clunky we have something better to fix it whatever it might be right that's the relevant thing to say so you should always stick with relevant not personalization and so this clay graduation workflow if you're not familiar with it we're launching eight campaigns from one clay table and so this is to sell offshore Talent uh recruiting services and so over here we're saying hey companies that already hire internationally we basically just want to say hey they're already hiring internationally I bet they're hireing more people let's see if they're new in their role we're going to reach out to them if they've been found it in the past two years our messaging is basically like hey you know you've only been in for two years that might mean that you're not you know you're not uh uh the best at recruiting we can help you with offshore Talent blah blah blah blah and then we have our LinkedIn post lead in over here as well too which I think some of the gurus would say that hey this LinkedIn post this is a personalization has nothing to do with the rest of the message now it could be the fact that I suck and that these messages are terrible for the companies hiring internationally it could be the fact that companies hiring internationally might be the wrong signal here my hypothesis was if you hire people internationally you're going to hire more people that didn't turn out to be the case we probably should try it in reverse too I'm fully admitting that maybe our copyrighting could have been better but if you were to look at these four triggers and say what is going to be the best trigger many of the gurus would say the LinkedIn lead uh post lead in is the personalization and it's not going to be great because we're literally saying I saw your LinkedIn post about AI generation am I write that you help people do blah blah blah right the this personalization has nothing to do with the offer at all nothing but which one of these campaigns performed the best the LinkedIn post leaded by far this campaign worked better than anything else and uh maybe I'll do uh I'll add a video on at the end of this to to to show the the slack Channel but the LinkedIn post leading did better than anything else well I guess I can't do that because the email addresses are in there and I hate editing my videos I'm sorry guys uh but you're just gonna have to take my word for it that the LinkedIn post leaden did better than anything else in this this workflow and I think a lot of the gurus would say that you know that shouldn't work because you know this personalization has nothing to do with your offer and sometimes don't get me wrong I am saying unequivocally that you should always try to be relevant uh I've been I've been told that I am Ground Zero for spam so I want to make sure that I unequivalently am saying the best message you can send when you're sending a cold email is to think about what would you manually send if you were to do research how does that tie in with your value proposition and then how can you automate that that's what the best thing that you can send but sometimes trying these other things like this reaching out and talk saying something about their LinkedIn post it I think it works because cold email a little bit of cold email is about outrunning the bear where you don't have to have the best email in the world you just have to be better than other people's emails and even though this didn't help our messaging at all uh from a value proposition standpoint you still got more positive responses and so this is just one that I think everybody should be trying a LinkedIn post lead in it's very difficult to scrape this data not a lot of people have it we use clay to be able to get the data it's one of those things still that if somebody sent you this email you would think they actually saw your LinkedIn post right it's not overused thing right now which maybe I make this video and it becomes overused but who knows and so I just wanted to make this video to just show that one LinkedIn posts as a first line is great and so far we've seen it work for everything this was just one of the glaring examples that we tried to be relevant and the LinkedIn post crushed it and some of you guys might in the comments say you could have been more relevant blah blah blah all these things whatever I get that I know we could have been better we could have always been better but the LinkedIn post crushed everything else and I just wanted to put out this video because I thought it was really interesting and um maybe it will help somebody else improve some of their own campaigns so thanks for watching and leave a comment with what you think\#\# Date Posted: 2024-04-01

\# everyone kind of a different post today just because I'm not going to be showing any workflows I'm not going to be sharing my screen I am just going to talk a little bit about what we're seeing in outbound for 2024 and I I would even shorten that to outbound in quarter one quarter two of 2024 and some things that we have learned I maybe have talked about these things but this all got sparked because I was talking with a venture capitalist in my network and they made this huge outbound doc and in my opinion they were missing these three things they included many versions uh kind of hitting on these things but I wanted to make these things explicitly explicitly clear and so the three things that I think that they were missing uh about outbound in 2024 is that one those that give more make more two long sequences are completely dead and three uh testing value propositions is maybe more important than testing triggers and all this other craziness so this video is literally just going to be be me talking about this which might be the first time I've ever made a video like this so uh let me know if you want more takes like this but anyway so one those that give more make more so I am sure if you've been watching the channel you know that I'm a big fan of Alex Heros he came out with a book called hundred million dollar leads everybody should read it the main thing that he talks about is that if you want to get more leads you you need one a great offer which is what he talked about in his book but in his first book but or $100 million offers wasn't his first book um the other thing is that you should be having these Mini offers called lead magnets and so the best lead magnets are things that you can give for free or you can do for free that the prospects know other people are charging for so one lead magnet we have in the agency is for some people we'll just set up boxes for them on their behalf for free so I'll take the hit I'll pay the 100 bucks 150 bucks whatever it is we'll set up inboxes and you know they could start using them within our smart lead account and all that other stuff right another thing we'll do is give away 5,000 uh contacts in their ICP for free and we'll validate all of the emails sometimes we'll even throw in some mobile phone numbers depending on what our clay credits are looking like that day and all those things see how in both of these cases these things are like or are there companies who are genuinely charging for this like they know that this costs money so this isn't my pre-recorded webinar it's not that 53 page document that there's still people viewing that document three months after I wrote it and I've only posted about it twice I know that that document is valuable but I'm still not using it as a lead magnet because people just see that stuff and they say ah you know they're just trying to get me to view something a great lead magnet is always something that people know other companies are charging for and you're giving away for free and so uh our newest partner Hans was looking at our past uh campaigns and he said Hey What Can we replicate here and I was like hey this is tough 17 out of the 20 of these campaigns all offered something for free and even though we recommend that for all of our customers not all of our customers really can offer something for free which I totally get I completely understand one of our customers the only way they can provide value to a company is after they integrate with your entire CRM with their entire Erp with your entire stack and then you have to use it for like a week and then you start getting value out of it right so I I completely understand that um but I always push them there's got to be something that that you can offer for free right and those and those campaigns really really Crush um in comparison to the other campaigns so number two long sequences are dead I I will I I will die on this hill um I I do not understand how anybody thinks sending a 7 email sequence makes any sense by any stretch of the imagination at all Bar None I would even fight you to say anything over four emails is too many emails in a sequence as well I I really really truly believe this and so for everybody watching this saying oh but I get all of my positive responses on email six the rest of your sequence is garbage then I guess like because every single campaign we run and I I don't care what you say every single campaign we run the number one performing email is email one and if we ever find that a different email is performing better in the sequence we have always taken that email whatever the core of that message was moved it to email one and then it outperformed to the other email one so I will say broad statement to anybody email one should be your best performing email in your sequence and if it's not if you were to take whatever is working in email 3 and make it email 1 it would perform even better and so so um there I think there's a lot of reasons for this uh one so one email one is just your best performing campaign so why would you waste your email sending volume following up with some dude for the fifth time or woman following up with with some person for the fifth time and they've already seen your offer five times and they haven't responded versus having a choice of reaching out to somebody completely net new why would you ever make that choice so right now we're sitting at like most of the time we're sending three email um sequences right now just because because we're coming in and we're saying we're giving the offer and then whatever we didn't have time to say in the first email we're digging into and we're giving more uh context about the outcome in the second email and then in third email I pretend to send them a completely net new email I don't follow up to the last one I just try to recreate that first email experience all over again and um if we were talking about saving time in the first and second email we'll talk about saving money in the third email or we'll just go in a completely different Direction with the value propositions and so um that's kind of how we structure it and why would I keep hammering somebody on that the other thing is your data is going out of date so if you pulled your data and you're reaching out to these people for a particular reason by email five it's like not relevant like whatever data you pulled isn't relevant anymore you also don't have anything new to say in the emails you're just rehashing the same stuff and then you're just becoming annoying um at that point and so yeah that's another reason I don't like it um the other thing is if you're sending you know eight emails in your sequence and you get to email six and you're like oh but people positively responded to this one I promise you for every measly positive response you get on email 6 there are 10 times more people marking you a Spam and unsubscribing from your sequences so like that's just bar bar like I fully that that's just what's happening right so you're just killing your email domain the more that you follow up these people and then the thing is is you can still get seven touch points with all of these customers but what you could do is you can run through your entire list first send them a three email sequence learn from it refresh the data refresh the copyrighting and then run through these people again with another three email sequence and you're still going to get I know I said seven but you're still going to get six touch points there why throw them in a sequence where again you can't say anything new there's not no more interesting insights you can give you're just automating the crap out of these people and so that just has never made sense to me um at all and so finally the thing that is probably the the most interesting for us and we're rebuilding our entire onboarding infrastructure to be able to handle this is that testing value propositions I think as we get more into what we're doing now is more important than the triggers so I know all of my videos up to this point are about workflows and Ai and data scraping we could get this trigger and we could say this thing and we we're just finding that the comp so we have three situations in the agency either we work with a company and it works the very first thing that we try works which is great that's what what we want with everybody um or we have a situation where the first things that we try don't work and then the company they want to move on to other channels and I completely understand that and more power to them or they say hey we really like your guys's work let's keep trying and let's keep trying to to find something here and so we go on this path of like testing and testing and testing and testing and very few times have we ever found a trigger that really made the value prop shine better versus just testing better value propositions so like there's this one company that they do AI customer support for e-commerce companies like you can call in and the AI will handle the customer support phone calls and so we tested eight things before we found the thing that worked the best and it wasn't a trigger it was a value proposition and I would say that happens more often than like one time we had this company that basically there's not a whole lot of different ways that you could say their value proposition it's basically down the middle every time and so then um for that company we found that when we reached out to Founders who have never been Founders before people really responded to that messaging and so um you know that like so I know I gave one example of value proposition testing and one example of triggers but I have to say what we see more often is we find the value proposition that people care about um that Pro for every time that a campaign goes from a losing campaign to a winning campaign I would say it has to do with value propositions that offers far more than it does the triggers and so like I said we're rebuilding our entire onboarding process to to make that happen so anyway these are just three things that are kind of on my mind about outbound right now that I think I just wanted to share with everybody I never do videos like this so comment if you wa you know one if you even watch this whole video but too if you'd want to see more videos like this um this is kind of what we're thinking about right now so I appreciate you watching thanks so much\#\# Date Posted:

\# Copywriting Examples for Cold Email Campaigns

all right hey everyone this is going to serve as copyrighting part two and our last video we went over this document and I just wanted to go over some examples that we have written in the past so here is our Tapo campaign um it's one of my favorites that we've put together because I think it just like shows off so well how we can do the problem sniffing and um you know put a good offer in front of people and so uh I'll zoom in uh saw one of your recent LinkedIn posts about and then we used AI to generate like seven to eight words of the summary seems like the last time you posted was number of days days before that though if you're trying to build your brand on LinkedIn have you considered using a scheduling tool our scheduling tool can help write your post and help you monitor social trends that you can Riff on as well let me know if this would be useful and I can send over access and so here I would consider this a hard call to action right and so right off the rip we have this where this is our problem sniffing hey it seems like you post on LinkedIn often but you need to be more consistent with it and then we have our poke the bear question right and so poke the bear if you're trying to build your brand on LinkedIn have you considered using a scheduling tool we're not just talking about you know LinkedIn generally and and how they're growing and what's their overall Str like what's your overall strategy to growing on LinkedIn no no no to the point are you thinking about using a scheduling tool our scheduling tool and so now this is like we actually have no social proof in this campaign um maybe we should have added more social proof I don't know this is just kind of the way that it is so uh let me know if this would be useful and I can send over access okay great um so now here's our follow-up email which it actually doesn't follow any of the Frameworks that I I spoke about in the past uh what I was going for with this follow-up email is one problem with follow-up emails is that um most ways that people send follow-up emails has no real life similarity to the way that you use follow-up emails when you send follow-up emails something happened in your life that means that you're actually going to follow up with this person right and so that's the human way to do it right and so what we're trying to achieve with this one is we are basically saying hey like the reason I'm reaching out is because your post came across my screen again and I wanted to reach out so hey I just saw your post about AI generation it reminded me to follow up and see if you saw this we'll go over this workflow later to show you how we built this in clay.com but basically the the secret here is that this LinkedIn post that we're actually regarding is actually their second to last LinkedIn post and then the number of days is the time between their second post and their third post so that we could do the workflow once and then this email would work we'll see it you'll see it in the workflow but anyway that's kind of our secret to getting this done email 3 first name I keep seeing your content online so I made some post ideas considering what your company does and how you promote it so this is completely new email new subject line I'm pretty sure I forget what we use for a subject line for this but like a subject line I would use here would be like subject um saw your post actually that's exactly what I would do saw your post and then here I would put like subject LinkedIn well let's LinkedIn ideas right keep seeing your content online so I made some more post ideas considering what your company does and then we used AI to create post ideas this is just some examples of what our AI could generate for you and you haven't even given it your insights yet let me know if I could send over some access for you to try it out we got um you know a person who's actually a cold email agency a very large agency to respond to this email and they even said like this email is really really good um and I do cold email for a living so you know really take that compliment let me know if I could send some access for you to try out they actually didn't want to take sales calls that's why we keep talking about access um I guess a little Easter egg here is the way we did this is we had like a loom video and we would send them the loom video and in Loom you can have that button call to action and that button would go to um free access account so they'd be doing like a two-minute vssl and then um they could sign up for Access right there so then this is our email 4 um honestly this is a little bit complicated but it's a little bit different from our breakups because I knew I could do another value email um just like how Facebook pages killed their organic reach it can be expected that LinkedIn will do the same one day I saw your LinkedIn company page had number of followers and you had about number of followers so we'd be like you know LinkedIn company page has 500 followers and you have 5,000 followers um as you are building your following are you maximizing the platform's organic reach before it gets oversaturated we've helped these companies could I send you access we also have a LinkedIn resource with 30 Niche ideas blah blah blah so this is a framework that of emails that we sent um that I think is a really good example we had we would get tons of responses every day on these campaigns this was a really really high performing campaign um and yeah one one of my favorites here and so then I'm going to show you uh a campaign we have sent this on our behalf and then booked too many meetings so if you're an agency owner you know do it it it works um I was on your site and it looks like you sell to job titles so we' be we'd say like it looks like you sell to VPS of sales Chief Revenue officers and sales enement leaders or something like that we prompt AI to build that um it looked like you're trying to help blah blah blah blah blah and like prompt that as as well I had to assume we were using outbound tactics considering and then we would scrape an SDR on their team um and then we' say like considering Mark Wahlberg is anr on the team are you thinking about how you could be leveraging beta data and GP gp4 to do their prospecting the reason I asked is because helping companies automate their cold out Outreach um would it be worth a chat to build a custom outbound workflow for you so see how like we kind of have an offer in here we kind of have a little bit of a lead magnet about like building this custom workflow but not really really this whole campaign hinges on This research up here and them being impressed with in my in my business my email is my product so we're all we're doing is just getting like impressive like first lines going for them that hopefully they would find Kudos in and they did um people really like this campaign um as you're helping people AI generation I'd imagine you're using marketing TCT tactics like the following um creative ideas right and so then we would just like literally have ai create outbound marketing campaign ideas um and then we'd send it over to them have you cracked how to do this Persona targeting and data enrichment automatically or is your team still using tools like sales naav to do manual research um if so would it be worth taking some time to show you how we can automate Persona and account research for your outbound team which is what our company does right and so another like super super personalized for email too so then um I named this one showand tell first name I sent an email a while back with the subject outbound Edge that probably didn't do a good enough Job showing you how we could help your outbound team our tool combines over uh 40 databases I guess we should say our system I wrote this for clay as well um our system combines over 40 days databases into one spreadsheet so that your team can see all the data in front of them instead of manually researching accounts for example at your company it looks like your sales team has grown by percentage in the past three months your LinkedIn company account has gained this many followers in the past three months and um it looks like you have uh this many like overall salespeople in your company um besides cute things like this we also monitor for recent news open job positions tech on site uh and mention and like keywords mentioned in job descriptions and a lot more on a call we can build you a custom uh workflow want to make it happen so again just really really just showing off to them what we can do here and then uh last email I figured you sell the customers like three customer types I went ahead and pulled them off LinkedIn for you using our system no human wrote this email and then we literally are putting in like name their LinkedIn link and their email um in here and then we also put their job title I just didn't update the copy we also put their job title to be like you know these are the contacts want to see a video of how I did this automatically so again we really lowered the barrier of entry for them to respond and then we you know sent these kinds of emails um and so yeah that's a campaign that we've worked and we've run with in the past I actually like except for this lead magnet here of like want to see how a video of how we did this automatically we don't use lead magnets I'm I'm just really digging into the data Andy trying to create a really good email for them that they then think like oh I want to make emails like this for myself too and so um yeah that's that's those now the clearbit campaign and the optivo campaign I haven't actually written out so the clear bit campaign we talked about already and so basically that campaign is we're basically saying like hey you're using clearbit most times when you talk to companies they're wasting the clear bit data can we build an automated workflow for you to you know take advantage of the clearbit data there's the whole offer basically right there with tivio it was kind of similar too and so what we did for them is we pulled so they're an intent data platform and so um we pulled a segment that both they wanted to Target for outbound and two there was a lot of companies that were um looking so it was like HR systems or something like that and so we pulled the list of every HR System company and then we pulled like the top 100 companies that are resar searching um hrr technology and so then we emailed all of these HR companies and we were basically like look you know I was researching your company and it looks like you help HR teams accomplish XYZ um I used our intent data platform and here are the top 10 companies who are doing the most research around HR technology right now um and then we literally listed them out we're like 1 2 3 four 5 six seven8 nine 10 and then we we basically said like uh Hey if you want the list of the thousand people the thousand companies just send me an email back and I'll send you a thousand more companies that are qualifying for this kind of research and if you want to see how this sausage is made Let's book a call and I could show you how we know that all of these companies are researching for HR technology right now and so that was basically the campaign um on that one and so yeah those are some just examples of campaigns the way that I think about campaigns when we get to the standard Playbook section we're going to go over a lot more of these but I thought it was really relevant for the the copyrighting section my friend Jed Marley so sorry Jed uh Marley Marl uh not sure he also has this content here which I think is really good where he's got all of these templates I'm going to link it um I thought a lot of these were great because I'm very much focused on like your cold email like overall framework and these give Frameworks for you know the the rest of them and so I really liked his stuff um and yeah uh this is the examples let's see if we have anything else to go over oh yes uh so we'll we'll cut off at the examples right here and then we're going to talk about some mistakes and and things like that\#\# Date Posted: 2025-02-01

\# Scoring E commerce Brands With Claygent and Zenrows

hey everyone in this video I want to go over how we built a lead scoring model on behalf of a customer so that one we knew that they were an e-commerce company and then two we knew that they had enough web traffic that we could actually help them and so this is very much a lead scoring video we basically use zenr and uh store leads Apollo and clent to make this table happen and hopefully it should give you some good ideas as well if you have a list of companies so basically what we did is we pulled all of these companies from this right here is Apollo data and we pulled all of the companies from Apollo that had Shopify as a technology now you would think many of these companies are actually um e-commerce Brands but some of them are Consulting companies they're not actually uh e-commerce Brands here and so the first thing oh hold on all right sorry about that and so what we are trying to do here is we are just pushing all this data all this just got uploaded nothing nothing crazy here and so what we're doing is we we first want to find how much uh for one do are they actually using Shopify according to builtwith and so the way we're scraping that data is we're normalizing the domain and then we're creating the builtwith domcom URL if you don't know this builtwith gives their information away for free on their SEO pages and every builtwith page is just builtwith dcom backom and so if we normalize this domain it'll just be builtwith dcom Tristy boom and it's just out there so we're just confirming and now we don't have to pay for the builtwith API we use zenr to get this data and now we're just confirming okay do they mention Shopify on their builtwith page so Apollo said they're using Shopify now builtwith says they're using Shopify I feel pretty good about this right then the next thing we're doing is we're using we're trying to use similar web well if they don't have Shopify then we're going to scrape their similar web page and if they're not using Shopify we're not even going to run this but we're going to scrape their similar web page to find their web traffic right and so what we're trying to do here is try to figure out an estimate of how many website visitors they have similar web is the same as builtwith every single page is similarweb.com back website backd domain and it's all set up that way and we can scrape it with zenr right here to get the data so we have all their traffic estimates here as well too which we can filter by later so then F so now we know okay Apollo said they're using Shopify bth said they're using Shopify what is happening with their website traffic okay we have that now we're going to use Cent to figure out are these e-commerce stores actually e-commerce stores or not and so what you'll see a lot of these say true and then some of them say false I would actually say most of the time these say false just because the website isn't actually accessible and so you could see here oh I'm only sharing the tab sorry but some of these when they say false for the most part it's just happening because the website isn't accessible but it'll give us the reason um if faciliates oring and carry out delivery for a physical location they mentioned gift cards okay so this is a perfect example of what we're trying to look for docs bbq.in e-commerce brand no and I'm looking at the site and I didn't think I would go onto any other pages so I didn't but so clent was able to tell that for us here and it told us for 0.0061 so now we can create a lead scoring analysis here where we're saying okay they are using Shopify and we double confirmed Apollo said it and builta said it we know their web traffic so now we can filter by their web traffic and now we're having Cent make the e-commerce analysis now we can also you can look at my prompt here so you can see what's going on but essentially it's pulling things that aren't traditionally e-commerce or the website doesn't exist and we shouldn't be reaching out to them anyway either and once this loads I can show you what this prompt is um but so if anybody else is trying to do any kind of e-commerce lead scoring I would say one this prompt is Banger to figure out if it's an e-commerce company so you should definitely be using this and we are using 40 mini we use 40 mini for everything but uh maybe I'll put this prompt in the description so that all of you can have it but then Define column outputs e e-commerce stores true or false and then boom that's just what we're looking for here and so if you're trying to do some lead scoring e-commerce companies are weird right because now I wish I could find like a technically Joe Biden for America has a Shopify store store and I'd be very curious to see what it would say about that uh let me pause the video and let me run that for everyone okay I'm sorry I keep trying to add things to this list and it's not really I keep trying to come up with a company and I can kind of understand why Clay is naming them a uh an e-commerce brand trying to think of somebody that is kind of an e-commerce brand but wouldn't really fit and so anyway whenever we're doing this kind of classification that's really really tight we will most often use um clent to be able to figure it out yeah see I mean I think it's it's I can't even find one that's not not good so anyway it uh I just that's basically just what I wanted to show everybody is you can have multiple levels of scraped data Zen Rose really helps out doing this and then Cent kind of puts in this final analysis for us and it's super super super cheap to to find these results so I hope that's useful for anyone trying to do scoring on your own\#\# Date Posted: 2025-02-01

\# Overview of Trigify

hey everyone it is not very often that I get as excited about a software as I do with trii so I just wanted to make a video about it because I think the founder of trigery Max has been doing a great job building this product and building this company it started first as a uh you know you would be able to pull people who had open jobs and uh there was news and things like that which you could still do that inside of trigery it's great it it still does a lot of this uh this stuff the I think the craziest thing that trigery can do is you can monitor a person's LinkedIn profile a individual LinkedIn user uh like a contact and you could also monitor a company page and find all the people who are interacting and engaging with the content and then on top of that you can filter by their title and their seniority and all of these things so that you can reach out to people who are engaging with so these this is a list of 2,000 people who are engaging with my content so these are all these people who are engaging with cold email content and if you wanted to sell cold email Services well I would say cold email software would be the best thing to to sell to these people and you'd be able to reach out to these people and uh so this you can upload and add new profiles of people that you want to monitor but then you could also listen for certain topics so if I would put in here cold email I would also be able to search for people who are talking about cold email so Patrick I know he just post this posted this I just saw it uh cool Josh Brun posting about cold email then you can find these people who are posting about cold email and then you can Target them as well too you can filter you can do and then you can send all of this stuff to Clay and so again here's how you could set up the the the triggers and everything and so I think just real quick with the engagement uh I think the way like you get what they liked you get what the post was get their title you get a lot of things that you'd be able to filter by and then you can select all of this stuff and then you can get AI signals you can enrich it you could save and then you could export it to Clay I'm not sure if I'm really doing it justice by making a video like this but the setup is so so so easy you literally could just come in here and you just add another profile and so I'm just gonna say I'm trying to think of somebody's profile I know off the top of my head so linkedin.com backin cold email that's my friend Andrew but he hasn't posted in a little while so I wonder what we'll get with this and we just throw this in it's literally this simple to just set up a profile and then we're going to monitor them daily oh and then we can sync it and then we can put um smart tags on here it helps you identify the social interactions which we're not even going to get into now and then I can find anybody who's interacting with my stuff push this to a clay table and then I can get anybody who's interacting with with Andrew eler stuff and then push them to a clay table as well now when you're running this play I would be aware of a couple things here so one people have well people are currently doing this right now they are taking my LinkedIn engagement and they are cold emailing people who engage with my content one I'm making a video about this I'm totally fine with that the the thing I would just be careful of is if you are targeting another bootstrap founder who's put put a lot of work in into their content and then you are selling the same exact thing that they sell over email I don't like to do that so anytime I use this data I'm never doing that we will Target very very large Enterprise companies and then we'll Target people who and then we'll just go by topic and then they're not selling the same thing I I feel like I don't like using this when you sell the same thing as a person who is um you sell the same thing as the person that you're targeting the engagement of so for instance one person was targeting all of my the people who are following me and they were selling their Clay course all the content I've ever created about Clay is absolutely free kind of scummy that you were selling a clay course right so um that I would say is my one caveat with this uh I I like to keep it to topics and finding people who are interested in topics and then not trying to sell them the same thing that everybody else wants but I just wanted to show this as a platform because I think the engagement is wild these are all of my posts it's all of the the you get the post here you get their title you get what they did they liked they commented whatever and then you can listen for certain topics as well too whoops and then here you can even listen to more topics and then filter for things and it's just it's just a crazy tool I think everybody should check it out um the first day max showed me this we paid immediately I I really really like this as a as some outbound campaigns and I in our uh gex wrapped 2024 doc when we look back on outbound I think in 2024 we're going to say that social signals are for sure the signal of the Year this was uh it's so effective to be mining LinkedIn for this information and then targeting people it's really really great so I hope everybody checks it out and uh give Max a shout out for me\#\# Date Posted:

\# Claygent Prompt to Personalize (almost) Any Cold Outbound Campaign

hey everyone I know it's been a long time and I hope this microphone is okay um but I just wanted to put out a YouTube video because I haven't made one in a little while I just created this for a customer and I thought others would like to see it one thing that we're currently thinking about in growth engine X right now is how can we leverage GPT 40 mini cost decreasing and how can we start using more AI in our campaigns and so we had one custom where they said you know what the best thing that we've ever found that manually works for our outbound campaigns is we find a case study mentioned on their site and then we pull it in to the um the Outreach copy and then they also really like to look for any media mentions so if the company has ever been featured in anything and they said we've never been able to automate this before and so if you've been a follower of this YouTube channel for a little while you know that I've already made a video on how you can find case studies but I just rebuilt this promp and I'm going to show you how much more specific it is it is finding amazing information and it is just so ridiculously cheap it's like 0.1 for finding the information and it's really really really great information so our ultimate goal here is we want to be able to first look to see if they've been featured in any articles because they actually said that was more important than the case study two can we find any case studies and these are for local businesses they're not SAS companies or anything else so they're just looking for those kind of case studies and then three can we just find something notable about their company and put that into the email as well um and I'm even going to edit the prompt because I just had another idea as well too so this is what the prompt just looks like and so I'm just saying visit the website of the company in my input I want you to do as much research on them as you can until you find sufficient data about their company this is the website I want you to look at blah blah blah I want you to check for multiple items in order important so first first we're looking for the media sources and so again this still follows my framework for AI prompting anything we just don't have the examples so again if you haven't been a follower of this YouTube channel uh to AI prompt for anything in my opinion you need to generally tell it what you want it to do you need to give it data to reference from you need to give it examples of what to look up and then you need to give it examples of no you need to refine I'm sorry I got to restart that one you have to tell it General what it's doing two you have to give it data for it to reference three you have to refine it even more of by giving it better directions of what to do and then four you give it examples and so uh here I'm saying this is what I want you to do we're not going to give them anything to reference because the website is right there I want to know if any uh featured in any cool articles already the way I do this and so here we're giving it the example the way I do this already is when I'm looking at a site is by reviewing the content of the site for any mentions of as seen on or featured blah blah blah any kinds of keywords like this um and I even say this might not be true for everyone but try to do your best then for looking at their website find a case study and all of these different things now I'm actually going to make this number four because another thing that popped in my mind is so we're I made this list mainly for architects in here but this company they are targeting all kinds of local businesses and so it's going to be more than just Architects and so another idea that we can throw into this agent is to find in particular keywords or names of products of things that they actually sell and so if you're interested in seeing the way that I come up with these prompts I'll just go over this right now you can skip this part if you don't care um so basically I would love if we accidentally start reaching out to a restaurant which that wouldn't happen in this campaign but a restaurant might not have case studies and they might not have mentions of news but I would love to be able to inject into the email copy um some of the items that they sell or something like that so another thing that you can research for is the particular kind of products items or services that a company sells so now I'm telling it generally what I want it to do it already knows to reference the other stuff so I'm going to say if I were to do this manually I'd be reviewing the site for exact keywords and specifications of what this company actually sells now I'm going to give it some examples but since these examples are going to be baked into our prompt and we can't move it around I'm going to preemptively tell it hey these examples have nothing to do with the input they're just examples for you to learn from so I'm going to say um exactly that for example here are some situations of research that you can do that has nothing to do with the input they are just purely examples and should not sway your output for any reason other than formatting and understanding what I want you to do if the website in the input is a retail company I'd love to know the names of the products specifically listed on their site if the website is a Service Company I'd love to know the specific names of their uh service packages and possibly their pricing if the website is a restaurant I'd love to know the name of food on the menu do not limit Yourself by thinking that these are the only possible inputs there will be a variety of inputs given to you these are purely examples a good way for you to think about this and this is a good prompting piece of advice good way for you to think about the output I'm looking for here is pretend to be three separate people each of you are looking for something in particular about what the company sells have a conversation with each other about what is the most specific thing and the most detailed thing that we can add to our output and output that so that the person we are oh no the company that we are researching is impressed by our Outreach cool and so now this might so a couple things here one this might be really long and you might think wow this is so expensive I promise you it's really not going to be that expensive when it all shakes out two I really love using this prompt I don't know it just gives me really great results when I use it of telling it to be three separate people and then have a conversation I don't know why it it just works really well and sometimes I'll even use this as a system prompt and I'll even identify what person one is looking for what person two is looking for and what person three is looking for and then I'll give it a road map of how to make the decision between all three of the people and this just works really really well so in cagent you can't have a system prompt but sometimes we'll use this when we're doing really complex stuff uh in the regular chbt integration and um here I could even Define it to say like this is what this one's particularly looking for in this one is what this is particularly looking for but we won't get into that too much so let's just keep going with the prompt generally I'm just saying if you can't find any of this just find something noteworthy about the company I just wanted to just come back with some research about the company then this is where I get into just begging the um AI after this and so I'm just saying do your best to complete the tasks above take as much time as you need to accomplish them and don't rush rush everyone online they don't make fun of me but everybody makes a comment about how I always say um please do your best to complete this task because my job is dependent on this I see this improved results so I add it in all the time um another thing you want to make sure is that you're always getting the information from the website in the input and so I te tell it source of your INF information must come from the website and the input nowhere else because sometimes it'll go off and do crazy stuff so anyway let's run this again and see how it changes our response and I wish I saved some of these so we can read these while this is going so see how it found its Awards it found where they're F mentioned so this was already working extremely extremely well right and then we'll grab this one as well too and so then see how it already found its Awards and things like that now let's see if this changed it anyway o interesting it actually made it worse all right we got the past projects so that's really good this is really good okay great so what's interesting is this this one used to be really good okay this is really good what's interesting is that used to be really really detailed and it's interesting I'm just going to add a little bit in here and I'm just going to say um output create an output with as much detail as possible and don't be afraid to give as much information as you can as long as you are 100% confident that it is true cool so let's see what it did here oh so this time it got the awards so that's interesting that's very very very interesting that this time it got the awards and before it

everyone in this video I'm going to go over how we can use clay to build a list of companies that focus on artificial intelligence uh this is actually very easy clay makes this probably easier than others all you have to do is you have to hit new table and then hit companies and then hit find companies from LinkedIn now the reason why this is so easy is because most AI companies tell everybody that they're an AI company and so um that's all we really have to search for is in the company description we literally just have to put artificial intelligence in here I would stay away from putting AI uh you know what actually let's try this so if you put AI I wouldn't want like a word that contains AI in it to come up but if we were to put space AI space I wonder if that would work maybe this would work let's try it so within the United States let's preview this so we're going to put artificial intelligence Ai and then we're going to generate this preview and I'm just going to pause to let this load so it seems like actually putting in AI didn't quite get us what we wanted see how we have like uh media oh no I'm so so stupid why would I say that there was some in here that really don't make so happy that I guess a lot of these really actually do fit never mind this did work we're just going to confirm um by looking at their description so we're going to import these in and we'll look at the descriptions I'll pause for the import so just doing a spot check I mean all these companies are AI companies so it definitely worked great so that's literally if you want a list of AI companies this is how you would build it build it I'll give this list away I don't care um I've got 10 000 AI companies here based in the United States with all this information uh you'll see it LinkedIn as a Google doc at the bottom of the video uh so quick and easy one today I hope you enjoy it\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# How to find Influencer Email Addresses in Clay

hey everyone I'm getting a lot of questions about how you can reach out to influencers and find their email addresses off of Instagram or Tick Tock or Twitter or whatever it might be and the best way to do this is to scrape Google searches which we're going to go over in this video and so the platform I'm using here is Clay because it allows you to scrape Google searches straight from the platform and we're just going to create some Google searches that are going to get us moving in the right direction so we're going to hit new table and we'll hit Google Search now this is going to perform the exact same thing as if you were to do a Google search on your side it's going to perform the same thing it's just going to pull in the search results for you and so if we do a Google search query here and I'm going to write it out and then I'm going to explain it so we're going to say site instagram.com yoga and then we're going to put a parenthesis quotes and we're just going to say outlook.com or Gmail.com or hotmail.com whatever it might be and then we're going to end our parentheses and I actually forgot one thing we're going to put an and in between both of these this Google Search that I've created what I'm telling Google to do is I'm basically saying hey when you return results for me I only want the results to come from instagram.com uh no it's not going to come from Twitter it's not going to come from LinkedIn I only want it to come from instagram.com I want included in the search result to be yoga and so that is the kind of influence that we're going to look for we're going to look for yoga influencers and when you return me results from instagram.com and the results include yoga I also only want to see results that include yoga if the results also include outlook.com or gmail.com or hotmail.com and that's basically going to find all the people who have these endings in their bio which is their email addresses so we'll just put a number of results at 50 so we we don't blow everything up and then you could see everything we'll just give it a second oh that the data has loaded we can see okay we have this person's Instagram profile this is what their email address is and wow they got yoga gmail.com code for this I don't know how they got that um and we have all this information right so now what we can do is we can take the snippet and we can map it to the table and now in all of these we always have see how we have yogajules at outlook.com we have skyriveryoga gmail.com so we have all these influencers and their email addresses and we can just pull all that out by using clay and then extract URLs and emails from text we'll just map snip it in hit run hang on and now we'll jump in here and we can grab this email and then we can map it over and now we have all of these email addresses uh and so now basically the way that you would keep going is you would just import data and we would hit Google search and we're going to do the same exact thing but we need to do what's called spinning the search and so if I were to just put site instagram.com yoga and no gmail.com we'll just keep it easy this time actually when we do it like that we don't need parentheses anymore so if I were to keep searching this over and over again I'm going to get the same search results over and over and over again so we want to do what's called spinning the results and so by spinning the results we add something to the search that we don't really care about we don't need them to be in New York City but we're at least refining the Google searches here so that we're getting different Google searches so then the next time I do the search I can search for Los Angeles and then we can find people in Los Angeles as well so then we'll put just 50 here but you're by spinning it yoga and email is the most important part we just add something else that's going to give us more data and change up the Google search in order for us to continue to get more data and so see how you know up here we had 123 at gmail or 97 at gmail or yoga gmail.com and now with our new results down here after 50 we have completely different results and so then this works the same if you're looking for tick tock influencers or Twitter influencers uh the same thing just change out site ticktock.com site twitter.com and you're good to go\#\# Date Posted: 2023-03-01

\# How to use LinkedIn Sales Navigator Part 1

hey everyone so today I'm going to be going over how to properly use LinkedIn sales Navigator LinkedIn sales Navigator is one of the most powerful data Tools in Your Arsenal and I get so many questions about how do I build this list or how do I look for this Trigger or is it possible to get this list and it's it's almost always on sales Navigator sales Navigator gives you great access to lists and uh if you know how to pull out those lists from sales Navigator you could do some pretty pretty incredible things with it um so this is going to be a basic overview of sales Navigator there's tons of products that you can use with it of course I think that you should be using clay along with sales Navigator but this is going to be an overview just for sales Navigator so let's get straight into it so the first thing that I would like to go over when I'm going over sales Navigator with new people is all of the different filters that are here and available to you are extremely powerful um specifically going for current job titles company headcount current company uh a lot of times past company can be really really great A lot of times people want to talk to new startup Founders and these new startup Founders they want to make sure that they have some kind of track record and so finding companies that you or people that used to work at Facebook and now they're working at a company with one to ten people and they are in the c-suite this is how you can build an awesome list of people who just recently started their own company uh well actually we can even do years in current company less than a year one to two years and now these are most likely startup Founders uh that used to work at Facebook that now are on their own starting their own companies so anyway that's just a quick search that we could just put together using LinkedIn so all of these ingrained filters are extremely powerful but one thing that people don't take enough advantage of in my opinion is the Boolean searches so you can also Search keywords here up at the top and it will give you some great extra advantages in your searches so I made this quick search this quick sheet about Boolean searches Boolean searches are essentially being able to tell a database uh I want a bunch of things and all the requirements need to be true I want a bunch of things and if only one of the requirements are true that's totally fine or I want to exclude requirements for the list so and is the one that when you pair and with two search items or more than two search items you're telling the database I want you to search for these two or more search items and all of them have to be true or you're searching for two or more search items and it doesn't matter if all of them are true at the same time you can look for anything and then not is of course you want to exclude something so I have some examples here so if we're looking for usually when we're looking for decision makers it doesn't matter if we want the owner or the founder or the president or the co-founder and then we can even add or CEO right all of those would matter as the decision maker for the company same thing uh well then when we're talking about real estate agents right we want the real estate agent maybe we want a real estate broker but we don't want Consultants so this is good for it doesn't matter that we get a real estate agent and it doesn't matter that we get a broker we're going to say that they're the same things but we do not want to be talking to consultants and this is an example search that you can put in here and then if you want to search for doctors who are also pediatricians and both of those things have to be true we can use this uh in our Boolean search so if you're going to be using this Boolean search the basic way to do this would be to just come into salesnav and throw that in to your keywords and you will find a ton of different decision makers that you'd also be able to narrow down with these searches over here I don't see a whole lot of people using the keyword search filters this is how you get far more granular and you can clean up a lot of the mess that that LinkedIn might start causing for you here one recent update to LinkedIn sales Navigator though is if you go to current job title and you let's say we put chief technology oh that actually is not working let's try again all right we're gonna have to cut this out uh they don't do that anymore uh okay now the next part about sales navigator that is really amazing is your saved searches and the reason I love save searches is because they're Dynamic you can create the search and as people move in and out of matching that criteria you either expand your list or your list gets overall refined uh to match that so if we just restart and let's say I want to build a quick list of people who are connected with me who live near me so I want New Jersey so these are my first degree connections who live in New Jersey I've got six thousand this makes sense I live in New Jersey so that's great so we have 6 000 people near me I can save this search and I'm gonna call it first level connections near me so now over time if somebody moves from Miami to New Jersey it will expand upon this search and I'll get even more people who are going to match these results the uh another awesome trick that you can do with this is you can create a search of people that you have sold to in the past so let's say we want to actually type up we're going to look for my good friend Amelia the other thing that we can do is here she is we can click on this and we can hit save and we can add her to a list and so what we can do is we can add her to a new list and say sold to in the past and so now as I close deals I can continuously add people to this list now you might be saying now what are you going to do with this list after you've done that well that's a great question what I could do is I can use the workflow tab down here to pull up my lead list and I'm going to grab Souls 2 in the past and so Amelia is going to be the only one who's gonna come up here which is totally fine but I can also add change jobs in the last 90 days so now I can save this search and call it sold to in the past new job and so now I have a search of all the people that I've sold to in the past that I will get a notification when they move and I can then get a reminder to to sell to them all of these notifications go into your home screen where you'll be able to see all of these things so that's another way way underutilized piece of you know functionality within sales navigator that I don't see enough people taking advantage of creating a static list adding people to that list and then watching for triggers are they posting are they changing industry are they changing jobs you know what's going on people you interact with remove people who viewed your profiles remove contacted people so you can only look at net new people phenomenal workflow straight within sales Navigator so uh I just wanted to jump into activities and shared experiences because change jobs in the last 90 days and post it on LinkedIn are both two phenomenal filters that I see underutilized completely change jobs in the last 90 days is amazing because they are in a new company they have to get all their systems set up they need to get everything set the way that they wanted and then posted on LinkedIn in the last 30 days is awesome because it goes over the people who are active on LinkedIn only two percent of people on LinkedIn are actually posting so if you want to reach people who are trying on LinkedIn they're trying to build a brand they're trying to build their present presence that's an awesome filter for that one now the next filter I want to go in that everybody sleeps on is the groups LinkedIn groups is special in such a way because they have the worst Community platform probably on the internet but there are all of these groups that you can find so we have Real Estate Investors right this group is named Real Estate Investors and there are a hundred and eighty thousand people who are in this group yeah like I mentioned I'm not sure if you heard me LinkedIn groups is the worst Community platform on the entire internet so what did these people have to do they didn't find out about the group organically they didn't get referred into the group because one of their friends wanted to bring them in they went into the the LinkedIn search bar and said I want to connect with other real estate professionals or I want to connect with other people who think like me I'm going to use LinkedIn and see if I can find any groups and then they got Bamboozled into the worst Community experience ever but I digress so what this tells us is this is some cheap cheap intent data that you can get about people so there here's a real estate investor group but what if I wanted to talk to people who are interested in automation right this is a group completely about automation that there's a hundred and twenty thousand people that you can still set up your job title filters you can set up your industry filters you can set up your geography filters to search through this group for your ideal customer audience and you know that they are interested in automation because they joined this group not because they found out about it accidentally and ran into it not because their friend referred them in but because they took the time and they searched out the automation group on their own next little tidbit and this this one's a little spicy I use this one with care is this special connections of tab right here connections of allows you to do something that I don't see anybody talking about and I've used successfully in the past uh with sales teams that I've worked with and it works great what you can do is you can connect with sure you can connect with your your business partners right connect with your business partners search them for us as a connection so I can connect here and I could say Jordan Crawford give me all of the connections that I share with Jordan Crawford on a first second and third degree level up to a thousand results because that's what it's going to give you it's not superpowers that's what it's going to give you so wish Jordan Crawford and Aisha are always awesome thanks Jordan there's some probably some good people in here that he knows that I should know as well but what you could really do is you could jump in and if you know that somebody is doing a lot of LinkedIn prospecting you can start getting a glimpse into the kind of LinkedIn prospecting that they're doing and maybe even start trying to step into some deals that they are trying to step into so this isn't exactly a competitor but this is another one of my friends uh Jesse oulette connections of Jesse oulette and so what I could do is I know Jesse is prospecting on LinkedIn I know he's going after people new people are going to constantly be added to this list and I can start stepping into these conversations if he's talking to Ed I want to be talking to Ed if he's talking to Tony I want to be talking to Tony and we can set this as a saved search and as new people start being added we can start stepping into those conversations because he's doing the Prospect and he's already doing the work he's connecting with them so you can start doing a little bit of trampling on uh your your competitors competitors outreaches uh if you can get connected with them and they have this setting turned on don't tell them that I sent you though this is this is a uh a great one uh let's see so those are some nice tricks that I found with the lead filters we're going to go over a couple of the account filters but before we go on just play around with these filters they're incredibly powerful they let you slice and dice the data really really well and I see a lot of people not using some for really good features like years in current position years in current company awesome to find new people or on the opposite end of the spectrum awesome to find people who have been there forever activities and shared experiences is a treasure Trove of you know job changes and recently posting on LinkedIn all of those things so when we go to accounts there's not oh whoops I can't filter there's not as many amazing features in here uh to note but I will still point out some of my favorites knowing that they're hiring on LinkedIn great I I do like knowing that somebody is growing their company is trying to expand that's that's a very good trigger to have unfortunately we don't have any knowledge of what types of jobs that they're trying to hire for straight from sales Navigator so I wish we could do that but we can't do it right here recent activities this is great the senior leadership changes in the last 30 months funding events the past 12 months it's all right here you don't need an extra subscription you've got some great data here uh as well company head crown is okay company headcount growth is even better so I actually submitted three support tickets to figure this out because nobody would answer my question uh company head count growth this percentage is based off of the last year it is not based off the last three months it's not based off of the past six months it's based off the past year and that's straight from LinkedIn support so uh if you want to use that just know that it's from the past year uh what I really really love though is department head counts and department head count growths what a great signal for you know knowing that a company is growing their sales team or something like that I really really like that one um and then technology is used I wonder where they're getting this data from but it seems like it's a pretty wide database I think there's some things in here that probably aren't mentioned so we go to w I wonder if woocommerce was mentions let's see if we can find it oh no maybe it's not that expensive but anyway still they have Technologies if you can find a big one on here that matches yours I don't necessarily see sales courses for that yeah so we have Salesforce so oh we have a lot of things for Salesforce so you know a great technology filter over here as well so I basically wanted to make this video because I see way too many people asking me questions and I just say to them this could totally be made on sales Navigator you just haven't looked at the filters enough dive deep into these filters let me know if you have any questions uh this is something that comes up all the time and you can do a lot of creative things with and I think just more people should be taking advantage so like I said if you have any questions reach out to me on LinkedIn I'd be happy to help\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Automating Outreach to companies based on 7 Sales Triggers

hey everyone in this video we are going to go over a workflow that I have built if you are working for a customer support tech company or you're working for a customer support service company but both these kinds of Industries would be able to take advantage of this workflow and so uh in previous videos we've done a lot around personalizing each email in the campaign and in this one we're going to talk about here's seven different reasons that we can reach out to somebody that we can detect with data scraping and then we're going to reach out to them so I'm going to go into the outline first and then we're going to go into the clay table to talk about how we built it and so here are the seven triggers that I have built that we can reach out with and I'm going to explain them probably more in detail as we keep going through but at a high level we're going to check for a new customer support team lead we're going to check for the customer team growth by percentage we're going to look for a new product we're going to look for what Support Tech do they have on their site whether there's no Support Tech or are they using a competitor Support Tech uh we'll see if they're hiring for customer support and then we're going to see if they have a generic support email and we're going to couple that with do they have support technology or do they not have support technology finally I also wanted to include some AI that we could use in a follow-up message and with that we're going to get straight into it so the first one that we're going to go over is trigger one and so trigger one is we're looking for a new customer support team lead uh and so the way we're gonna do this is we're going to use the find people enrichment inside of clay and we're going to map the company LinkedIn URL and we're just going to look for some job titles I put in just four I would put in way more if I were doing this for real but basically what we can do is then set the parameter to look only for the people who have joined in the last six months so that we get the new people on the team and I took this a step further as well and what I did was so you know this person the first person in this row they now work at six cents and then the principal customer success manager but in the past they worked for a company called yext so what I did is I pulled in the last company that they worked for and then I analyzed what uh what tech that that company is using now so not only would we be able to reach out and say hey it looks like you're new we'd also be able to say hey it looks like you pass company you used um zendesk or drift and that's what we were using at your past company like what are you thinking about as you're shaking things up at six cents is basically the angle we could come at for that campaign the second trigger that we could be looking for is the support team growth so what we could do is we could compare this column has all of the people in the company who have support or success in their title and so it's right right here job title support or success and so what we can do is we could find all the people who have recently joined in the six months and then do a comparison so like they had two roles of all time one of them have joined in the last six months that's a 50 increase but not quite a great reason to reach out because you know going from one to two is nothing crazy but something like actually nobody is that crazy here maybe 50 adding two roles in the last six months and they had 15 years pretty interesting but everybody looks pretty basic over here so we could reach out by customer support head count growth by percentage and then the next trigger that we could reach out by is by product launches because when a new product launches you got to be able to support it and so we could say we could use Ai and I didn't do this here but we you know from my past videos that we could do it so Sixth Sense launches AI writer tool we could say hey saw the recent news about six cents launching the AI writer tool and then we can use AI to deduct what support might have to be done on this so we could say I figured customers might reach out for support around things like utilizing the new AI writer tool in their sales process awesome line I figured customers might reach out for sport around things uh like understanding how to implement elation's new open data quality framework after you know they just launched a new open data quality framework so I think that one's really good too the next one that we'd be able to look for is a presence of competitive technology or do they even use technology or not so down here it looks like this company is using zendesk this company is using zendesk this company is using help Scout and drift and we can detect all of these things so if they have no competitive Tech we'd say one thing if they do have competitive Tech we'd say another then the next trigger is we can look for people who are hiring for these roles and so what we can do is open this up and we can see okay uh it looks like alation is looking to increase the amount of support team that they have what we can also do is if you run a support service or a support software also break this down using artificial intelligence and maybe I'll do this at the end of the video we can break this down using artificial intelligence and summarize what is this person going to have to be able to do and then we would analyze with our support tool or our support service depending on what this person would have to do how could we say hey we actually could help in that way like we could either give you another person who's trained on these things or you know how that you were talking about manually responding to emails you wouldn't have to do that anymore with our tool and so then we could do that analysis right in there using AI as well and then what we could also search for is like I said we could look to see if there's any contact at email addresses on the website this got a little bit crazy but see how it says info AC immune.com so then we'd be able to see if they have any um contact app email addresses on the site and so let's check that we make went through all the triggers so new customer support team lead if we showed customer support team growth we showed a new product launch we showed no support using competitive yep hiring for custom support great and then they have a generic support great and so finally I would basically reach out and I would use any of these as my you know why you why now and I could say um you know and I could go to this person and I could say Hey you know tsuchi I noticed that you recently joined the team over at sixth sense as a uh then we could just look up what they joined us uh so cheetah recently I noticed that you joined the team as a principal customer success manager uh over at Sixth Sense looked at your past experience looked like you were working at yext before that I uh saw that at this point yext is using zendesk and drift and you know it looks like Sixth Sense is using zendesk and drift as well okay you know I know you've had you know a lot of experience with these tools would you like how are you finding them you know are they meeting all of your needs it you you would have to put this in as you know more customer support things than than I would um and so then you know if it was the product launch we'd be leading with the product launch competitor Tech open sport rolls we could lead with all these things finally for the follow-up email I would keep reaching out and I would say I would ingest their company description and then say something about their customer support So for 908 devices there are chemical and biochemical analysis and simple handheld and desktop devices addressing critical to life applications okay great so we could send our email and we could say hey I figured customers might reach out for support around things like troubleshooting they're handheld and desktop devices are understanding the software automation process I I think people would be very accepting of that to happen uh this one looks like it's written in Japanese uh let's go where they oh yep it is Japanese so what do we got here wow AI translated it for us that's great I can't tell if this is correct but we're gonna take it for what it is and then let's check just one more um empowering the body's immune system to fight disease join us on a mission to eliminate neurod degeneration and cancer through immuno neurology and so then we would say we have our email and then we could say I figured customers uh might reach out for support around things like understanding the eligibility criteria for electors clinical trials right and so now we would have all of these different ways that we could reach out to a company we have a lot of relevance for why they should be switching we have a lot of relevance for why they could be enhancing their team and then we have this follow-up where we can continue and say very interesting things to them where it looks like we looked up their company but you know we're leveraging AI to be able to do this and the great part about all this is the way that this table is set up I could just come in and I can hit add a row and then I could just put in like ong.io and I'd have to search gong's LinkedIn and we would have this and then we could hit this and now everything is just going to automatically run for us super super easy and we don't have to do any work what we could do is we could set up over here and Export and it would be ready to send in our campaigns so as always let me know what you think uh this was a little bit different from what we've been doing the past where now we're just more focusing on triggers but I think this was a really interesting campaign to show off if you are running a Support Tech or a support service company as always you could reach out on LinkedIn if you have any questions and uh you know thanks for watching the video\#\# Date Posted: 2025-02-27

\# Every Revenue Team Should Use Clay.com

thank you so much I really appreciate that all right thank you all for having us today uh I am going to be speaking about a company today that I don't even work there I just love so much that I think everyone should know about it and uh with the this clay.com how many people have heard of clay.com before Okay cool so I might be preaching a little bit to the choir here but the only thing that I want you to take from my presentation today is to just try clay.com and I'm going to give you some reasons that you should be trying it but first I think every presentation should start off with why you should be list listening to me uh so I am the largest clay user on the platform I know this number means really nothing but uh the engineering team confirmed that we're the largest clay user on the platform by usage uh this is an a like the integration company that we use between our email sending and our CRM verified that we've gotten leads uh from like people have positively booked meetings for my customers with our outbound agency from open AI Apple beay jll Geico Microsoft Cisco the tons of others he couldn't even fit it into the graic um and then this is just me standing next to my little plaque that instantly. gave us that is a ascending platform that is a competitor to like sales Loft and Outreach um we they gave me a plaque because we generated 5,000 B2B sales opportunities in a year that was only for them they are my client and I generated 5,000 just for them we actually use a different platform for our sending which makes it a little bit tense sometimes and then this is our internal sheet where we generated 10,000 positive responses in uh over the past year for our our customers as well too and if you want to know how much clay expertise we have if you search how to use clay.com I know you can't see it but my YouTube video is the first one up there and then if you search clay.com tutorial it's clay.com and then it's my YouTube videos as well too so hopefully with that buy in you'll believe me that I could talk about clay.com and if you can't believe me then there's Donuts in the back and you take a break uh so what is clay.com they have on this website go to market with unique data and the ability to act on it sounds beautiful what really actually is it it's just a spreadsheet connected to a bunch of Integrations so you could do your job a lot easier right if you download information from your CRM because you need to clean up the emails you take that CSV and you got to upload it someplace else you validate those emails and then you need to find more emails because the original provider didn't have everything you take that CSV you download it you have to upload it to another place instead of all this download and upload stuff Clay is just a tool that you have all of the Integrations in one place and you set up logic so that you'd be able to run it what does this allow us to do just the normal things every person needs to do to clean up your CRM to run outbound campaigns whatever might be cleaning up names validating emails enriching for emails enriching somebody's LinkedIn profile finding LinkedIn profiles all of these things that can be done on the platform we won't have time to jump into all of them but I'll show places that we could go my bias obviously after you know you heard our intro I completely I forgot that I put in how many uh emails we send so I'm a little bit of a professional spammer for some of that that don't like it but um I definitely have a bias towards outbound email so a lot of the examples you'll see from my presentation or for outbound email but a lot of people are using it for their cold calling or if you're doing Enterprise sales to send all of the data to CRM so that the teams don't need to do the research and different things like that and so they raised uh $40 million at a $1.25 billion valuation and so then I just want to talk about what's all that hype about really what they're trying to do is they're consolidating the data market the same way that Zoom info has been there and Apollo has been there instead of trusting one data provider to get all the data they want to try to bring everything in and one thing that I like to talk about has anybody read the book flip the script by or claf so in one part of the book he talks about something he calls novelty chunking somebody was trying to sell him a refrigerator that had all these lasers and it had different cooling temperatures in one place and it had even a little heater for your fruits and vegetables in another place and there was all this crazy stuff and he said I don't want that just give me a normal refrigerator that's just a little nice than what you could get on the market and so what he called that was just plain vanilla with a Twist and that's why I like to simplify everybody sees clay and it's this big technological thing and all these things all it is is just a spreadsheet connected to other data providers and I'm going to show you some examples of what you could do with your marketing with it and so this I I apologize I didn't know we it' be a little bit small but this is just an example of all the Integrations that you can use inside of clay.com so if there's any data provider that you like they're up to over 100 Integrations at this point so if your favorite mobile number data provider is Lucia they're on the platform if it's Zoom info they're on the platform if whatever email finder you want to use it's all on the platform so they have all of the Integrations up here so whatever workflow you're putting together you could Stitch it together in one place instead of swapping in between all the other things uh and now I'm just going to give some examples of some emails that we have actually sent to people because we can scrape their data and then we use AI to normalize everything this we sent this on behalf of a uh Google reputation management company who they came to us and they said they sent 3,000 emails and they never got a single response and I said hey guys this is probably like the easiest like if if this email doesn't work just do not hire us because this is just like this is the only thing you could say hey I had a question about that negative review I saw on Google this is blocking a little bit but the one about RG Roofing doing substandard work that wouldn't pass inspection we scraped their Google reviews to actually find a negative review up there great oh substandard carpentry work that wouldn't pass inspection so here we're scraping their their actual negative Google reviews normalizing it with AI and then putting it into the email just straight injected into the copy is this having a negative impact of people walking to your business we're helping companies like you remove reviews like this in under seven days and you only pay when we successfully remove a review and of course then we have somebody positively responding oh I'm doxing their cell phone because I don't know how to use canva um and they said can I choose the reviews that are removed I don't want all the negative removes just the unjust ones I like okay whatever what you think about that sure and then here's another example and again this is in 15 minutes I'm not going to convince you that you should all buy clay and all these things but hopefully I can uh show you that you should at least try it what's the next one uh oh maybe it's maybe cool so now this was for a newsletter Network that this email seems a little weird because you might be thinking there's no way that they actually can service these markets but they actually can because they're a newsletter network of over 300 newsletters so we could say this hey Nicole we operate America's second fastest growing newsletter Network engaging over 3 million subscribers who align pretty well with your ideal customer profile and then we put in with AI their customer profile we scrape their website we normalize all the data and then we turn it into a customer profile that looks like this every time personality traits practical solution oriented seeking efficiency age range 30 to 55 gender gender neutral income level middle income level education level some college are higher then we AI generated this part too specifically it looks like you're looking to connect with couple seeking an easier divorce process I think we can help with that are you open to learning more hope to hear back from you soon and then again we're using AI to pull case study straight off their website saw JB's feedback about how your team was responsive during a tough time uh suggest you make a hard situation a bit smoother for many people could be something to talk about in the newsletter right all of those things just condensed from their website content put straight into the email and then finally oh this was really funny this is actually an email we send for clay.com and I thought it was funny because the response we got from this is it really depends see can I get the same person that built your email Tree in my setup because uh so this email we're using this to break into Enterprise accounts and I would s like very much say this is a very long email but we're finding that this is the best thing to break into Enterprise accounts we just got like pal Alto networks to respond just today um off this email and so we're saying basically I think you're using outbound tax to grow your company I bet your team reaches out to fintech entrepreneurs business owners and Regulatory Compliance officers before they do that do they do things like analyze the competitor's offerings in open finance do you track industry regulation and craft timely relevant Outreach do you research the founder social media to engage with personal insights on those marketing changes and then we're basically saying that clay can help them do all of those things and then we'll get responses like this of people who like they're like Eric you got to go talk to this person because they want you to set it up for them and so those are some of the crazy things that we've done for people in clay.com I it's kind of a a difficult platform to learn so we do have a a document here that this is our internal guide whenever I bring on somebody new to my team we teach them how to use the the platform by using this internal guide and I think we were so nice yes we got a uh a QR code for this and so in this uh link you're going to see a QR code that goes to a document to teach you how to enrich a company for their web traffic how to enrich companies for uh who raised money how to enrich companies for uh what roles they have open and who's hiring for those roles and then also just sourcing companies who are hiring for sales people or whatever you'd like to do and then I think we also have how to find local business owners with AI uh because you can't get them on LinkedIn so we use AI to manipulate the website to see who the local business owner is and all of those not only do I teach you how to do it in this document there's literally a copy and paste you can take my clay tables and just put them into your account and you could use them straight there as well too and then if you'd like to learn any more I also have a channel that I'm too lazy to put thumbnails on and if you'd like to also see all of our tutorials on this there's a QR code for our YouTube channel as well too and so thanks for having me today thank you so much thank thank you yeah no thank you excellent I\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

so if you are looking to build a list of companies that either are using your competitor or you integrate well with their Tech stack already targeting companies by technographic information is one of the best things that you can do and so there's very few times that I tell people that there's really no uh competitor on the market and you should just use this one tool in particular because there's always great like Shades of Gray about how they get their data and and things like that when it comes to technographics though I've really found that bu with is the best provider on the market uh any other provide like all of these providers are all doing the same things when you're looking at technographics so a word on that is usually what they're doing is they're looking at a company's website and then seeing what technologies they have installed on the website and then when they find the scripts that you know the Technologies are responsible for they say okay great uh you know they are using stripe or they're using cley or they're using HubSpot whatever it might be and so in order to to build up this database one you need to have a gigantic list of websites and then two you need to have a gigantic list of Technologies to check on those websites and BWI has just been in the game for so long that they have the most amount of websites and they have the most amount of Technologies built up and like I said there's really nobody who who Compares uh to the technographic information of built with so um sometimes people will come to me though and they'll say okay hey Eric I want a list of any company that's using QuickBooks and that you can't get with built with because that's not a website that people or that's not a tool that people usually install on their website usually that's a tool that you um usually that's a tool that you use kind of like we call it behind the firewall where you wouldn't be able to know that unless you worked at the company the only other option that you really have is to look at a company's job descriptions which you can use a company called predict leads to do this where you can look at their job descriptions and then pull out the Technologies from their job descriptions um so if you know no company is going to install sales navigator on their website it's just not even possible but they will say that they're hiring for sales reps that should be have experience with sales Navigator and so then you'd be able to check the job postings and see if they're using sales navigator that way but so builtwith Works off of if you install it on your website very phenomenal tool really really simple to use um a little bit of a hack as far as creating a workflow goes is word around the water cooler actually somebody who works at Apollo told me this is that the techn filter and I know oh no my camera is covering it a little bit um there is a Technologies filter inside of Apollo and I'm just trying to see if I can show this to you so this Technologies filter here right now and I know my videos in the way I'm so sorry this Technologies filter uh allows you to build a list of people and companies where the website has certain Technologies installed on them in this use case I'm looking at Shopify right here and these are all companies that have Shopify installed on their website what I have actually found is if you were to build a list in builtwith and then bring it over to Apollo especially when you're looking up a category like Shopify a lot of the times even though builtwith might have more companies like if we were to go here and see how we there's like in Apollo there's 471 th000 companies that are using um Shopify right and then here it's like right on their front page I don't even have to log in there's 4 million companies that are using Shopify as current customers a lot like this disparity often comes from the fact that a lot of these people who set up these Shopify stores they might have like 15 Shopify stores they do it as a career they they they're not going to create a LinkedIn company page for every single shop Shopify store that they set up so they uh you you can't associate contacts with every single one uh because of that reason they don't have a LinkedIn page and if they don't have a LinkedIn page how would you even manually figure out who's who the owner of the company and things like that and so um what I found is a quick and dirty way is if you don't have built with is to just come into Apollo and look up their Technologies because if I were to take a list of companies that fit my criteria upload them to Apollo and then filter them by uh the headcount and the HQ location and all those things and not have the Shopify filter on I might get like 5,000 contacts and then when I don't take it from builtwith and up upload it to Apollo but I just use the Shopify filter I might get like 4,500 contacts so there's going to be kind of a dip but it's usually pretty much the same thing and so uh I use like builtwith if we need the full lest and we need it to be really really really really good and then I'll use Apollo if I'm just doing something kind of quick and dirty and I just need it to be uh you know done fast and so uh yeah when you're targeting companies by technographics built with and Apollo are the tools that you should be looking at in order to do that\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Build an Analytics Dashboard in Google Sheets from Smartlead.ai

everyone in this video I'm going to go over how you could use make.com in order to build a analytics dashboard out of smartly.ai it'll also serve as a pretty good tutorial of building a workflow in make.com if you've never used make.com before as this uses quite a bit of functionality that you're going to need to be able to use and so make.com at its basic is a tool that is competitive with zapier where they already have the apis and the modules and the things hooked up you just need to map your own content and it'll work through it like a workflow um using each module is pretty basic and sometimes they're small little differences and you know over the course of many videos we'll get into that the uh thing that you'll see here is we need to use an HTTP module and the reason we need to do this is because smartly.ai does not have a module on make.com as of right now and so we need to query it ourselves so we're going to use the HTTP request in order to do that and then we'll talk through the rest of the workflow and we'll just talk about this chronologically so I'm going to pause because my API key is in here and I don't want to show anyone that with my API key deleted you are going to first need to query this URL now how do I know that we need to query this URL it is all in smart leads API documentation and so you might want to ask chatgpt you might want to watch another video on how do you read API documentation in order to know what you what you want and so we just know that we need this one from Smart leads API documentation and then the smart lead API key goes over here which I edited for this video and then we're going to use the method get this is all convenient smart leads API it might be a post it might be a delete whatever it might be but for this one it's get and then when we're setting this up we always want to hit yes on parsing this response um if you hit no I actually don't know why that's even an option to hit no because I've never hit no I always hit yes so anyway what this is going to do first is this is going to get all of the data about all of our campaigns and so if I delete this and let me just pause again and make sure my API key is there great so if we delete that and all I do is hit run this module only it's gonna it's thinking and it ran and now it's gonna be a list of all of my campaigns and so you'll see an input and an output bundle my API key is above this so I'm just showing the output bundle and this is the data we have like over 400 campaigns in smartly we have a lot 448 great and so you'll be able to see everything inside of here so if we were to open this up like we're not even running this campaign anymore but we could see all of the settings and we could see the scheduler cron value I think the ends yeah we you know you could just see everything that we need I think the main thing that we need is this campaign ID here this is the most important part and so now we had you saw we had 435 data points in there if we were to go from this module straight to this module uh we cannot dump 435 uh you know campaigns into one API because it's just not going to work the correct way so we need to use an iterator so what an iterator does is um this is just called flow control and it's just taking the data that we had mapped from the the smart lead request over here and see how we put in data literally all we did is you could just grab it drag and drop there so now you'll get all of these campaign IDs and instead of sending all 435 campaign ideas over to this uh HTTP module it's going to split them up and send them one by one because uh that's just how we need the API to work and so now we're this module this is going to get us the actual campaign analytics this is where we actually get the data that we need to know about our campaigns before all it was telling us was things like you know the settings and the campaign ID and all these things over here we're going to run that so I'm just going to pause it so now you'll see that this is calling the analytics but we needed the campaign ID which is why I needed to start with this one first because I don't have the campaign ID so it's not going to work for me and so I got The Campaign ID and then we have the analytics the API key all these things so this is all in the smartest documentation we just for placed his campaign ID with the one from the iterator over here because remember we don't want to pull it from over here because if we set do that we'll pull like 435 and just blast this and it's not going to work it's going to be invalid over here this is where it's going to work and so now again we have all this set up and we're just going to query for an API and so now we can just do a quick test uh and so I'm going to back out of this and I'm just gonna pause I'll show you how we test this quickly so again I'm going to pause for my API key way that we could test this module is we could just go to like 289 yeah this was a long time ago great so we have the idea is three eight five four zero now we put in the ID and I can't get this to show without showing my API key so we're gonna have to just live you're just gonna have to believe me that now we'll get sample data and now that we got that sample data we would be able to move that to Google Sheets and so we used um Google Sheets as the database here and the reason why we have to start with search rows is because we need to know does this campaign already exists inside of the Google sheet because I don't want to just keep adding rows I want to update a row and so when we do a search row we are searching for the data name from over here and so if we get the uh campaign name and so you'll see like in the mapping um yes over here like it'll say data and also it'll say the campaign name and we are searching by this campaign name and we want the text to equal that if it does not find the campaign name we're going to add a row and we're going to add all of the analytics if it does find the campaign name we're going to update that row and we're going to do it there instead and so this is you know generally how we have all this set up I would say and so um if you have any questions like I said I'm going to be doing a walk through of make.com on a more uh basic level but this is how you would put this together I will download this blueprint without my API key and then upload it next to this video so that you can see exactly how this works and then you can copy and paste it and just use it yourself too um I think the only other thing to show is that this would create a campaign analytic for all of our customers and this is just for our customer one schema and so uh one other thing is we have a filter over here to make sure that the client ID equals the ID from Smart lead that we need them to equal um and then that way we're not running like 435 and like you know mixing clients and things like that we take care of it with the filter right here and so at a high level yeah this is how we get it done\#\# Date Posted: 2023-03-01

\# Creating AI Generated Lines for Cold Email

hey everyone in this video we are gonna go over how to create AI generated emails uh using clay and open Ai and so in this video we're going to walk through a couple of examples of the way that I see that we can use AI uh in our cold email campaigns I will be doing all this live I haven't tried any of these before so we're going to jump in and see if we can do some some correct prompting uh the last video that I did you might have seen got taken down because I showed personal information so we are going to personalize these emails on the account level and we're not going to do anything more than that and so what I have found so far with using open AI is that the AI is good when it comes to cold emails it go it is good in three things the first thing is if you want it to structure unstructured data so if you have data where it says like this company's Glassdoor rating is 4.6 and then the next data uh row it says 4.6 is the company's glass door rating that would be really tough to write a you know a script to pull out their rating because you know there's there's no structure to that data so asking AI to structure that data is a really good use case the Second Use case I see is to write just to snippet just to answer a quick question succinctly I would say is another use case to use open Ai and cold emails and then the third is to obviously write a fully fledged cold email using Ai and so we're going to walk through specifically the snippet and writing a fully fledged email in uh open AI but I would have to say that the best still is structuring unstructured data and um uh oh and writing the Snippets writing a full email is still a little hit or miss so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to pull up our AI writing tool we're going to complete a CR prompt so I have my API key and so what I did is I enriched these companies for data about their LinkedIn profile so if you look we have their LinkedIn URL the size of the companies are they privately held what's their website the country their founded date website uh industry locality locations description all these other things now description in my opinion is the most interesting thing here that we can start asking questions of AI so I'm going to say something like uh write a line for a casual email answering this question uh pleading this prompt the input uh no review each input for context about the company input is this input right here and so I'm actually going to put quotations too so it knows what I'm doing we're going to put the description of the company quotations so I'm going to say the input is this and I'm going to say tell me more about now tell me in less than eight words what types of companies does this firm invest in complete this prompt while you do it to detail uh it looks like on your website you invest in and we'll we'll see what it says all right so basically we're being very very specific we're going to write the we're telling it hey I need you to do this thing uh this is the input and then I'm saying do it in less than eight words what does this company invest in complete this prompt to do so it looks like on your website you oh let's do that and let's hit save changes so we are going to use DaVinci 3.5 to run this and so let's just run a couple of them and we'll see what results we can produce okay North American Middle Market companies let's check experts is leading alternative since it's found in the furnace firm is a leaning Capital Partner for a North American Metal Market companies nailed it okay that's very very good all right so actually let's map these to the table so we can review them a little bit easier let's get all of this data out here so this is one problem that I'm having with openai is sometimes it says you know the prompts that I give it it'll say it looks like on your website you invest in and then boom it'll put that in there and then sometimes it'll just completely leave it out and it's like ah okay um all right so companies with high growth potential let's check out this one 68 is a private equipment specializing growth Equity suits you invest in companies with high growth potential yes great okay so I mean it nailed it that that is what they say not that specific but okay that's fine looks like it's on your website you invest in technical startups we have a invest in technical startups from idea stage to series a we start companies too thanks I Founders really appreciate the the words of wisdom there okay uh let's look at this one Cerro Capital it looks like on your rest fight you invest in technology-enabled sports companies we invest in technology-enabled companies so investing in the future of sports we invest in technology-enabled companies cool so I nailed it on that one let's do this uh nope I think we did this one away looks like our new and you invest in Innovative tech companies and builds creates a bills because that aim to make life and cool okay so as you can see oh let's see if this one nailed it nice okay this one nailed it too so as you can see we have two problems that we would need to solve for one is more important than the other the first one is the fact that some of them include it looks like on your website you invest in uh you know that blurb that I told it to write and then some of them don't which you know within clay we would be able to clean up those things and I'm not too worried about that that's an easy fix the second thing that we would need to fix though is sometimes they're nailing it right on the head so if I were to send this to it looks like on your website you invest in technology enabled Sports companies for serial capital I I think that's extremely reasonable for somebody to manually research 100 that's you know really good uh North American Middle Market companies not as good but at least you know that that is what they say they invest in uh right here uh diverse founder solving problems this is good to see like Innovative tech companies might fall a little flat though and so let's try to re-prompt this to be a little bit more specific and I'm literally going to say that um tell me in lesson eight words what types of companies does this firm invest in how can I say this better tell me in less than that others might Overlook I'm just asking it really what my thesis is here is to prompt it to give me something more unique about the output than just what it's giving here so let's see it looks like you invest in overlooked Middle Market companies okay that's better diverse founder solving problems I wouldn't want to change this one this one's really good it looks like on your also invested up and coming online entrepreneurs see I like this one this was one of the ones that wasn't that great hard to reach Venture opportunities where'd they get that is a venture capital specialized Niche Focus we make see this is better so with this little prompt yeah with this little prompt it got way way better uh to to find those things and to write these lines so now instead of manually doing all this research we could just feed this information to open Ai and we can get these first lines where we can clean this up and I'll say you know it looks like on your website you invest in these kinds of companies and then we can get into our pitch or whatever else that we're gonna add so now if we're reaching out to these companies we have a pretty good account level uh personalization that we could add to our emails let's see if we can also get uh something to say to the individual person so we're going to map this LinkedIn profile here and I'm actually going to pause again to hide this column I'll take the summary out but I'm going to hide this column because uh YouTube is going to get mad at me okay so we did enrich people's LinkedIn profiles over here which not everyone fills out their LinkedIn profile with their their summary and their job summary so uh I hid this information so YouTube doesn't get mad at me but so now we can try to run another open AI line and I just want to ask it you know what are people focused on so in my email could I say you know hey it looks like on your website you're Focus like the company's focus is this and your focus is this uh so we'll prompt this again and so we'll say um using the input I give you tell me complete the prompt to tell me what this person's focus is in their job the input is and I again I like to be very clear with what the input is so we're going to say the input is oh wait actually we already have it their input is their LinkedIn summary we're going to use their LinkedIn summary for this one so this is the summary that everyone has generally on their LinkedIn profile uh not the job one actually let's use the job one for this one so sorry just because we are asking what their job is so the input is this uh the prompts I would like you to complete is it looks like you focus on from your Li profile it look it looks like you focus on and then we'll just leave that the prompt I would like you to complete is tell me what no I think we're fine with the prompting I don't want to over prompt it okay now we'll hit save changes and now let's try these Whoever has the job summary already filled in we'll run a couple of those okay and so it already generated response let's create a new column okay acquiring and managing Sports organizations that's great because they are a tech enabled Sports business it's like you focus on high delivery it's including Facebook strategy and copywriting whoa okay interesting so immediately we're gonna have to change this prompt to shorten it I'm investing in food Management Service with great okay great investing in early stage fintech and Marketplace startups yep okay if it looks like you focus on economic development yep from your link to profile it looks like you focus on Operational Support advising and sourcing opportunities for investors yep yep Okay cool so the only prompt we're going to do is we're just going to change this to just say the prompt I would like you to complete in a less than eight words is for me like the profile it looks like you focus on Save changes okay let's do this this this this this this was even out okay that's a little bit too small Focus this so this was better um so you know how we use you know the prompt in the last one it looks like you invest in these things that other people might miss let's try that so The Prompt I would like you to complete in less than eight words is tell me something specific that they are looking for their role let's try this let's hit save changes this looks a lot better growth of technology companies for me it looks like you focused so I exploring new Partnerships and avenues okay great yeah so that is some better lines from their LinkedIn profile I wonder if it would be beneficial to keep including you know the longer ones because the longer ones were pretty dang specific uh so that was pretty good let's try um let's drive pulling some news about their companies maybe some Investments so let's go to predict leads here and find most recent news by domain now I don't care what the news is I just want to say six months ago and just let it ride because what I really wanted to do is I just want to say I saw the blog article or I saw the news article you know and I'm gonna I want to summarize the news in this one oh no events found yep that kind of makes sense these are smaller companies whoops looks like we have to run a couple is this just because let's see optionally all right let's take the the news found date out that might be screwing us up here ah there we go okay here we go here we go so what I'm going to give it is I'm going to give it the events that I required so now I'm just going to say hey let's do this complete prompt and I want to say hey from the input help me complete my prompt this is the input I'm going to do the text body foreign and I want this text body article body so I'm going to say that oh let's put quotations around everything from help me complete my prompt I want to know specifically what this article is about this is the input I'm gonna say news article so maybe it knows a little bit better is about this is the input my prompt is I saw the recent news article about and let's see if we can nail it with just that just keep it nice and simple so let's run the ones that have events and let's see what we get map this to the table so we can see a little bit better celebrates the news record articles oh yeah we need to keep it short let's shorten this up uh this is the input complete this prompt in SN words okay changes hmm let's change this and let's say I want to know specifically what was the news article about and why it is important let's try this one foreign as well hmm because I don't even have to look at these these uh inputs it just looks like it's far too General far far too General invests in human Ventures LLC invests in see that's not even foreign let's just see what is the main announcement in this article let's say news article as well so it knows I am talking a little bit less but if you made it this far in the YouTube video congratulations uh we're just doing a little bit more experimentation here beautiful hmm yeah we have to play with this one if we want to use it for news this isn't specific enough um what we could absolutely do remember when I was talking about in the beginning structuring unstructured data what we could do is we could use this to just find nice clean you know summarization so this is a title human Adventures invest into Upstream in 12 into Upstream in 12.5 million yeah yeah so what we could do is we could grab the sentence Oh let's try this article sentence instead actually all right so let's open that back up so instead of article body let's take the article sentence cool all right let's try this and this will be the last one and then we will wrap up this video and we can try this again another time yep so it seems like it came with basically the same response uh so I guess in the next video we'll focus on some you know AI creation but anyway uh thanks so much for watching this video about how we're trying to create these these cold emails and thanks for coming along the the journey with me\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

so when you're in need of more custom scraping that comes with a click um there's a software that I use that is one of my favorites to get this done and it's kind of hokey to use it it's kind of weird it's like this this tough software so um I would say if you can't do it with this software you should probably just go to upwork or another platform and just like ask somebody to scrape the data for you as a you know salesperson marketer sales technician I'm calling it now that you you have to have your line where you say to yourself hey this isn't worth it for me to do anymore um I'm not going to take care of this I'm going to offload this to a more technical person and so if you use this tool and it doesn't and you can't figure it out this is kind of the line that you should um offload it to somebody else and so we have the HubSpot directory here which if we wanted to scrape the HubSpot directory we open up instant data scraper we're scraping it um but we're not getting everything that we want from the page right we're getting their link this looks like we're getting their website but we're not getting the website from everybody so this doesn't seem that great so then we click in and then we see like their whole uh section here we see their reviews we see their website we know that they're remote we get like the actual things that people say in their reviews and this is the data that we really really want so in the scraping world this is called clicking in to a scrape and there's Chrome extensions that do this that I've never been able to to figure out and so I'm just going to show the solution I've been able to figure out this is a desktop app called scrapestorm that I've been able to throw crazy stuff at uh scrapestorm and it's worked really really well for me and so um what I like to do so you there's a smart mode where you could just get started and just jump right in and start using uh this stuff and so if you hit get started then boom we can jump in here and it's going to automatically detect the data on the page and so um it autod detected well it says failed but oh it autod detected and it failed on the pagination so we're going to have to teach it how to page okay and we'll go over that and so basically the first thing that we want to do is we want to line up and get the reviews when we click into this so it autodetected the page type there's either a list page or it's a detail page list pages are like this when there's lots of structured data and it's the same every single time there's a list that that's exactly what this is um the next page is going to be a detail page and so in order to get to the next page what we're going to do is we're going to click on the column here and we're going to hover over this and we're just going to click this button over here where it says scrape in so we'll hit scrape in and now we're we get a preview of this um page over here so now it correctly selected it as a detail page so now we have the opportunity to add field so if you try clicking on anything it's going to like say all of this stuff to you so you say got it whatever what you actually want to do is you want to click add fields to the right over here and then you're going to get this magic wand button we're going to hover that Magic Wand Over the visit website it's going to say this field contains URL link would you like to scrape it yep that's what we want so we'll hit it'll say visit website here but we'll get the website um from them then if we want their about section we can just hover over the whole about section we could get their whole about section so we could feed it into chat gbt and then if we wanted like this person's review right then we could get their review feed this into chat GPT and say like who is this review from right and so um yeah this is how you would map it now we need to go back though and like I said we need to fix the pagination problem and so it says Auto detect fail because it couldn't detect it so when it says next page button here so in pagination with like scraping there's either a next page button or it's a scroll to load scroll to load is very obvious because if you keep scrolling down and it loads more data then it's scroll to load next page button is really great because um well no it failed to detect that this is the next page button so all we're going to do is we're just going to click select button we're going to click next and now we're all set up so now we can just let it run we'll hit start um a lot of this stuff doesn't really matter you can just hit start there's going to be some stuff that I'm going to want to talk about in a little bit so now we're just letting it run it's hitting it it's doing all the clicking and then we're going to get some data from this yep so we got blue leads um smartbug should be next yep so we know it's going in order and see how we keep getting the websites and so as we're setting this up you just want to make sure that you watch this watch it paginate through like three pages that's like uh so then you know that it's working and it's doing everything so I think there was like 50 results on each page so we'd wait until 50 to get there but for now we're just going to pause it and we're going to going to click on edit so what this tool can also do is it can scrape things behind a login what I will say is do not try to scrape LinkedIn with a tool like this um just don't even mess with it like try not to scrape LinkedIn yourself like as much as you can just Outsource that don't don't do it yourself um you can get your account banned and just don't do it but if you are trying to scrape a company that has a login um this platform can take care of that um and see how it says pre-login right here it'll open up a page for you and you could essentially like click around and log in and do everything that you need to do and then it'll save what just happened so I just clicked architecture imagine if I just logged in though I click login succeeded and now I've just like filtered it oh it didn't keep architecture usually does I guess if it doesn't change the url and like your cookies it's not going to keep it but anyway you could do a pre-login over here what you can also do is you can solve captures um with this platform as well and so you basically would would just come in here and you could solve the capture manually they also have the ability for you to solve captas with like a provider so this one's really good for that as well this like I would say though like their their support docs are really not that great past like just like scraping data and then clicking in and then bouncing out and scraping the next one I really wouldn't recommend this this is getting to that line where you should probably just Outsource this to somebody more technical than you um because they're going to be able to rip through it way faster than you just trying to figure all this out just go to upwork and literally just post a scraping job um but scrape storm will be able to get you a good ways there and then the domain for it I think it's just scrapestorm decom yeah and so then this is scrapestorm uh.com and uh yeah you'd be able to get the download all of this stuff and this is what I basically use so yeah\#\# Date Posted: 2024-04-01

\# Data Scraping for Cold Email Tutorial Part 1

so in this video what we're going to go over is scraping a lot of Brands websites uh and we'll use whatever scraping techniques are necessary to be completely honest if you're watching this video and you've never seen my channel before I am not an engineer to be quite Frank I don't even know what I'm doing I'm just going to show you the best ways that I know to scrape this because I'm trying to create videos that I wish that existed when I started learning these things and now uh you know I'm just going to produce it for what I know at this point um and also I've never seen these websites before so not even sure if we'll be able to scrape these things I just have five tasks in front of me and we're going to try to get it done so let's jump in but first we have this cpg dxyz brandbuilders kind of thing and we need to be able to scrape these and so this is the page we need to scrape and it looks like everything is just popping up now if you're new to scraping see how when I first was on the page see how it would kind of like we'd scroll all the way down and then it would load more and then we'd scroll the way down and would load more it's called an infinite scroll as far as the What's called the pagination goes so you have to think about that when you're doing your scrape the other thing to think about here is we want this information but when you click yeah we have the website and we have their location we have a description we have some nice things in here if you are using this for lead generation having a website is one of the most important things and so we're going to try to grab that website and if we can't we'll just use something like clear or um cayen in clay.com in order to grab this stuff so the super basic way to get this done is to just use instant data scraper and then roll through all of these which we can do so we see an instant data scraper we get all this information okay cool the biggest thing we want to make sure though is that we get the company name and so right off the bat it looks like we'd be able to get this using instant data scraper we can just put on infinite scroll and then just let it rip and we'll just make sure sure that the number goes over 50 oh for those actually I am just realizing for the YouTube video you all probably cannot even see that I'm using instant data scraper actually I think I'm just talking to nothing oh no I think it's working I don't even think there's a camera on right now but anyway so we are scrolling through we just got 150 if you cannot see my instant data scraper screen right now I apologize after this one we'll restart the video with a full screen view but see how I'm not scrolling on anything and it's just rolling through and it's just collecting all the information that's one way to get this but now we're going to actually pause this and we're going to try a different way which I am going to pause this part of the video and and share my full screen way that we could get at this is so what you're looking for is a scraper that can scrape this and then click in and then scrape this and so um there's actually a scraper that can do this called scrapestorm This is it right here and I just realized that I changed computers and I don't even have scrapestorm on this computer right now so I guess we'll just download it right now and we'll see if we can get it up uh super quick but so scrapestorm has the ability for you to do that let's just see about scraping the other ones and uh we'll go into a tutorial of scrapestorm so founder made yeah these are just tough because you almost have to just click view all let's see if we click on this yeah then you get their products when you click on it so this is possibly a scrapestorm scrape as well but instant data scraper is going to be the best thing for you to grab everything that you can this exhibitor directory okay this is interesting as well so I'm just going to click on this and just see how everything's made okay so the website is there oh so we have to paginate this too okay so this is a perfect perfect situation for scrapestorm so we're just going to install scrapestorm right now and so you guys can see it literally as we log in um I'm actually going to pause the video and I'm going to install scrapestorm so you don't have to bear watching me do this all right so I've downloaded scrapestorm we're going to go back to this exhibitor directory and I'm going to I'm going to copy and paste the exhibitors uh like the link that we're looking at right now and then we're going to go to scrapestorm I really hope that you can see my whole screen right now otherwise we're going to ruin this part of the video but we'll see so we're gonna this looks super complicated it's actually really simple to be able to use scrapestorm you just have to know what you're looking at so we're going to click enter a list or table or web page to scrape automatically and then we're going to just click get started it's going to put you straight into smart mode for if you're watching this video and you have to learn from me you should only use Smart Mode don't worry about flowchart mode this is like a crazy thing to to try to learn so we'll open up this uh right here and then it's going to automatically try to find what you want to scrape and okay so it did it incorrectly that is not what we wanted it to scrape so it was using autod detect and uh it did not detect what we wanted it to detect so we are going to select it on the page so I click select in page we're going to go to the top we're going to click this element and then we're going to click this element and so now we just told it hey the thing that we want is these things right here and then see how it says paging and it's going to say autod detect success that's not true see how it's it's hovering over this too that is not is not a success so we're going to hit select button and then we're going to pick our click button right there and now we should be good to go now the thing that we need to do is we need to be able to click into these to get more information so what we're going to do is you're going to hover over the name link or the link that passes you to the next one and you could tell that this link brings you to where you want to go because if you click on it straight from here it's going to open up the page that we need and so that's exactly what we want to do so now we're going to oh geez okay we're going to delete this confirm that we're deleting the page and then we're going to go back to this one you probably didn't even notice this tab so look at the bottom left over here if you can't see my mouse this tab is what we're doing what we did with that so now we're going to hover over everything here and then see this button scrape in so we're going to click on scrape in and now it's going to open up the the the thing that we need so now this page type is a detail page a detail page is I mean I'm sorry but this is a detail page I don't know really what else to tell you so now we're just going to map the the detail detail page it's like that Meme it's like uh that guy who is like this is a this is a tree because it is like I can't tell you why it's a detail page it's just this just is so we're gonna have field one and then we have we're going to point it at the website this field contains a URL link would you like to scrape it I always do because why not because this is bush beans and then this is bush beans you have two of them deal with it later it's not that big of a deal whenever you're scraping you want to grab too much information because you don't want to go back and try to redo the scrape so we're just going to keep clicking ad field and we're going to grab everything that we can what link is in there I don't know okay so that's an expo link we'll grab it it's fine whatever we'll grab it so then we'll hit that we'll hit that so now this looks like this is all of the data that we want to be able to grab ooh what's this contact button we always want contact buttons let's click add field and hit contact ooh okay so now scrapestorm does allow us to scrape in again within scraping in so let's just check this out and see if it's worth it and is it worth it no it's not okay so we're going to delete that that's not worth going to yep delete that okay cool so now what you can do is to keep yourself organized you can rename the columns while you're here so I'll be like website and then we'll say Stephanie we'll say contact one it's a little tedious to keep renaming these and it's so much easier to do in a Google sheet to rename these things so when I do this I like to just do the super obvious ones that we should just have so this is company or I'm going to call it exhibitor name because it's bushbeans.com and I don't think all these companies are from bush beans so I'm just going to say exhibitor name and then we have the website which we need this is just the website again this doesn't mean anything this is just their category then we have contact one now that I have contact one here I'll remember like this is contact two this is contact three this is contact four whatever and actually we could just for the tutorial if you want to know you could also delete these columns when you don't need them and you just do it like that now we can just hit start and hopefully the magic will happen hopefully so we just hit start and we pull up this interface which honestly I just like feel like a hacker anytime I use something like this so it's extracting the data okay perfect so now we got one we got two we got three so this looks like it's working you can see what's going on by clicking show page so we got Spring Bank honey what do we got 100 100 pure cool and everything so now one thing that I'm watching out for right now is we are not getting the website for everybody so what we're actually going to do is we're going to expand this and just try to see what it sees ooh very interesting okay I'm glad this is happening so that we could go over it um okay so we're actually going to stop this and we're going to run it again so we're going to export this later don't worry about it so to edit you're going to click this pencil button over here so what was happening that was so interesting we were oh what the heck I want to go back all right I guess it's going to force me to do it this way okay oh oh it brought up my workflow again okay so what was happening that was so interesting when you scrape like this it is telling you okay what the sometimes this will happen and what I like to do is to just restart but I don't want to restart but I guess we'll have to so let's go through this real quick one more time just let it run do its thing and I'll just skip through everything real quick because it wasn't loading list page selecting page because this this is super important to show you what just happened because this this is going to happen quite often and you really need to see this okay so now we're going to scrape in we're going to get ourselves set up same way that we're were doing everything before okay so before we saw that I was scraping name name website categories from here problem came up though the I'm not sure if you saw it because the video was going so fast sometimes that it would say name and then it would say like founded date and then it would say categories and then it would say website and it's like oh shoot how are we supposed to possibly get structured data if that's what we're we're getting right so if we just bring everything back again the same way we're going to set it up all the same exact way right Stephanie what's up Kate oh we didn't get Stephanie's link but that's fine cool right so now what we're going to do is if we can't get that website the way that we think we were going to get that website what we can do is we can add a field and see how this whole box lights up with blue we're just going to grab the entire box so I'll click on that and see how in our preview here we got everything later we can use a regular expression or we can use AI to just say in this text here what's the website the other thing that we're going to do is if there's only like one employee I'm not sure if it's going to capture everything so let's grab this box too and then again later we'll just ask Ai and we'll be like what are the names in here so now we'll hit start again and now we should be back in business the only there's one other thing that we just need to watch out for I'm going to let this run and then I'll show you if that comes up so now we're getting everything but we got everything the first time too okay cool but see now how in field 10 I mean you can't see it right now but we're grabbing everything in field 10 you can't see the preview but we're grabbing everything in field 10 so one thing that we have to watch out for is see how we have all of these right here all of these booths and everything I don't know maybe this is like 20 we'll call it like 20 what we want to make sure is that we do actually paginate to them the next page because if we don't paginate to the next page then we have to figure out what's going on and if we don't paginate to the next page we might be so and have to call a real engineer wow there's so many pages oh man I feel so bad for the person on my team who is doing this okay so let's go check out scrapestorm and so it's on 12 so right now you're doing a little bit of just like a sit and wait to be completely honest um because we just need to sit and see does it get past that number that we're looking for so we need to make sure that it paginates AB World Foods see this AB World Foods we need to wait to see AB World foods and then we'll know that it paginated so honestly we just wait five star food we can check in and see how far we are okay so we're getting there yeah 20 25 is probably what it is 5050 Seventh Heaven Come on Big Money big money big money come on all right I already I have a memory of a goldfish and I forgot what we're looking for oh AB World Foods okay on Big Money big money AB World Foods all right do we get the next one we got the next one okay and then we can just confirm what the next one is it's abbit we're still getting everything for the purpose of this YouTube video we're just going to keep moving on because now this is set on autopilot it's going to grab everything that we need and we're going to keep rolling through our list okay this one okay so oftentimes Brands like this will have a section so the the tough part here that I'm immediately seeing is they have non-alcoholic beers they have non-alcoholic Spirits they have mocktails they have mixers they have all this crazy like categorization of stuff sometimes what they'll do is they'll put somewhere a place where you can grab as many of the brands as possible in one go and so I'm going to look for that so we have featured snacks Pantry Bakery beverage pet sale okay and women founded Brands don't forget that of course um let's see there's sometimes a place where you can go and it'll just say here's all the brands a thousand healthy food products shipped from small independent us makers to your door okay careers standards about support seller sell resources bubble Goods rewards blog let's check resources because sometimes they'll say like join all of the brands that are on here and then they'll put all their brands on here this doesn't look like one of those times all right so check out new arrivals so again this would probably still be a cause to use scrapes storm but we want to try to find one of these that is so big like for 73 products is not that great okay 871 products this is pretty good and I want to keep going through this the featured section because it looks like the featured section is going to get us as much as we can I think we already did that one 871 Brands and best sellers most reviewed 871 okay that most reviewed and best sellers looks like they just did the same thing exclusives won't be it as seen on TV it won't be it BRS no no no so we can probably cover because what we're trying to do I don't really care about the products here I care about the actual brand of the companies so what we can probably do is we could probably cover as much ground we can probably cover like 50% of the website 60% of the website if all we did was just focus on most reviewed and just grab these or we could focus on best sellers whichever one your heart desires but they're all basically the same thing so now let's look at this structure bubble Goods e gift card okay oh wait this is the brand my eyes hurt so bad I'm so stupid why was I looking at that okay cool neck board sea salt crispbread okay what we're really looking for here is something to say what the company name is okay this is interesting this social is pretty interesting woman founded love that for you uh how to enjoy pack size allergy warning all right nothing is popping out to me here and saying oh yeah this like this is the brand of the company which is a little unfortunate we might have to use AI or oh wait wait wait wait wait I've been looking at this entirely wrong I'm so stupid Norwegian baked is the name of the company hey this might be the worst YouTube channel I mean YouTube video I mean maybe it is the worst YouTube channel this might be the worst YouTube video of all time because I've been working all day and I was getting tired but okay that's fine um there's another thing here to check out why no that's fine okay so we're going to set this up and scrape storm the exact same way we're just going to pause this and we're going to open a new tab so that we can just run some more things we'll just go home and we'll run this one back so we will hit this get started cool again super super similar process let it load let it map itself out figure out whatever it thinks you're going to want so now there's no website really on these so we could just scrape the surface level here and we're going to get basically everything that we're going to get but wait a minute I just saw something hold on let's jump in here never mind okay because sometimes they'll like they'll let you they'll let you scrape by like the company over here and but they don't have the list of the companies over here which is fine we'll still figure this out never mind all right so let's see what happens when we scrape into this and see if there's any information here that we really want I don't think there will be maybe this social link is worth scraping into maybe to just grab that uh but I'm not over the moon about trying to grab that okay wait that I actually clicked on the wrong link here that's bringing us to a collection and I don't want the collection right so what we're going to do here is none of these links are bringing us to the next page so we are going to try to click on one of these and see if that does it for us it brought us to the collections page again okay so that's not what we want now we're going to go back and we're we're going to try to add a field and we're going to try to add a field so if you click on this link this is like the link that's going to bring you to the next page so we're going to click on that ah this field contains the URL link would you like to scrape it yes let's see if we could scrape into that and get us what we need which we can so the H the unfortunate part about this is it like it all works based off of what is the first so the preview that you're going to see is what is the first thing here and I wish I could just delete this one because I don't I don't want to be looking at that one but we're gonna have to live with it so we'll see if there's anything right never mind it's not worth it I'm yeah we there's no website there it's not like we're going to get anything crazy important if we grab that so let's just make sure that we are autod detecting the paging correctly and let's just move on so we are detecting the paging correct irly we can hit start and then we can run this oh I would have to upgrade so we'll we we have this set we'll launch it when we're ready to set and then we can just move on to the last one subscriptions trusted by 1,229 Brands okay view Shopify App Store reviews nope NOP oh wait a minute so the request from our customer was to find anybody that is using this company and SK looks like it looks like a sass oh so then we're not even going to worry about this web development creative growth SAS compare case studies interviews Integrations API team pricing oh we're not going to worry about this at all we're just going to go to built with and we're just going to grab I think maybe our customer was like oh can you grab these people right here which I would just take a screenshot of this and just ask open AI uh just ask gp4 like all of the brands that they see um but the way better thing to do is just go to builtwith and download a list of all the people using SK so we're going to be good with that I hope that this was useful as a scraping tutorial where I kind of just went off the cuff not sure if anyone's gonna find anything useful from this but we just took it off the cuff showed a couple scraping um things ask chat if you need more help you know it always can help with that stuff so I appreciate you always watching the videos and uh this one's over\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

hey everyone today we're gonna check out a new beta feature that clay.com has just released that is probably one of my favorite features that has been released in a pretty long time this feature is called collagen at this point we might change the name who knows and so uh what this does is it uses Ai and some magic on the back end that uh the engineering atom on the team has created and it can do research for you on your accounts or I haven't tried it on people yet but definitely on accounts and I'm going to dive into some of the research that I've been doing and so this is our table so again it's in beta it's this right here Collegian again in beta you've got to be a clay customer and then you got a request to be able to use this but so far the results are excellent what you can basically do is you can ask for real-time data about these companies by talking to the Collegian uh and so here I've asked I think like over 10 questions and we're going to go through all of them and so here we are checking if this company is hiring no crazy prompt by the way a lot of people they're like oh what's the prompt that you put into your AI prompts this is not a crazy prompt here people and I can just improve this prompt to get a better answer is this company hiring for new people if so what people are they hiring for Salesforce yes they're hiring for various roles they're hiring for a Salesforce admin developer Salesforce consultant architect business analyst designer blah blah brex yes brex is hiring for various positions great so these are software companies over here let's try uh direct to Consumer customers cust companies uh gymshark is hiring and we have the links that they're hiring for yep and so we could scrape this if we wanted this is totally fine is liquid death hiring Yep they're hiring for various positions and it's on ZipRecruiter and their careers page and so here we have various positions that they're hiring for uh is Carlos Bakery hiring yes they're currently hiring for Baker's cake decorations sales and support staff and so if we go and we check on this this is from Carlos Bakery careers let's check it out looking for a career what are they hiring for join the Familia that's so funny apply here what are they hiring for job openings let's see these might be on ZipRecruiter or something yeah these might be on ZipRecruiter and that's just how I found it it's interesting okay and so let's check Ena gymnastics this is my first job that I ever worked at and they are hiring for teachers classes teams and parties yep that makes sense this is a pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company Yep they're hiring for new people and then this is Owl error.com Yep they're hiring for new people awesome and so then we can do things like finding the most recent blog what is the URL of the most recent blog on this website so we go check clay.com this is a recent vlog excellent that's I wrote that Vlog well with mishi's help this is security okay this is interesting towards the next generation of xnu memory safety great that's a Blog uh let's see fundraising Walmart raised funds in 2023 yeah well with an IPO yeah it's different Jim shark May 14 2022 with with a private Equity round let's see gone July 1st 2022 according to crunchbase excellent and see how the total tokens used I'm using GPT 3.5 for all of this and so this is costing like .006 so this is like half a penny to find this information imagine querying this from you know a data provider let's check if they have CSV mentions on their website yes Rippling mentioned CSV Walmart mentioned CSV Imports twilio mentioned CSV Imports apple does not these companies do not owler does this makes sense because these are all like Red Bull's not going to mention that that's awesome all right competitors and so we can build a list of competitors so to Salesforce Microsoft 365 Zoho singer on monday.com awesome in order of similarity we have monday.com click up smartsheet Trello awesome brex competitors Nevin ramp Air Base bills spend and expense okay these are all great great uh competitors office locations sales for and all I did here was prompted to just say how many locations does this company have Salesforce has multiple locations airtable has locations all over the place gong has five office locations let's see Walmart has 10 500 stores and clubs in 19 countries Red Bull has 172 locations amazing look at all this research done now this is a product check and I just basically asked it what does this company sell as a product or service in under 10 words airtable sells the next gen app building platform and connected data services yep clay.com provides data collection and Automation Services yep I put clay.com two times that's crazy gong.io sells a revenue intelligence platform perfect liquid death sells canned water a a gymnastics offers gymnastics classes uh Pella sells medical products and services the complement science excellent who are the investors boom we have investors excellent oh wow y combinator got into brexitude for them uh remote work do they allow for remote work yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes maybe not does not provide information \[Music\] it is unlikely that caffeine Batista allows for remote work yes yes it is 10K checks everybody asks about these specifically here I said does this company mention diversity hiring requirements on their 10K so we go to Salesforce the relevant sources indicate that salesforce.com mentions diversity recruiting and higher requirements but it's not specified whether this information is included in a 10K report so they didn't mention it on their 10K but it is mentioned across their website which is great so let's check this out nope that's 2013 that's an old one see this one 2016 that's an old one let's check this out 2022 and let's just go diversity and inclusion initiatives oh we got to work on that this is why it's in beta that's totally fine cool mergers and Acquisitions here I was basically asking is this a company that owns multiple companies or is it a company that is owned by or that is I guess an owner whoops I mistyped that salesforce.com is a company that owns multiple companies clay.com it was acquired by Solstice oh that must be old this is old crunch-based information for who used to own clay.com twilio is a company that owns multiple companies Walmart is primarily owned by the Walton family and the descendants of founder Sam Walton uh it does not be owned yep that's true Ena gymnastics and yep that's true yep videos on site I literally just asked it does this company have videos on their front page and yes there are videos on salesforce.com and I guess we can check that uh let's see braze yes they do have videos on their website boom here's the video on braze and then this one was like Off the Wall this one I shouldn't have really worked I just asked it can you find the LinkedIn URL of the person who would be in charge of hiring a new Finance team member in the New York City office for this company website um and so this is a shout out to all the Staffing and recruiting companies that they want to know exactly who is the hiring manager and so what I would do is I would create a dynamic uh token here for like where the job is open and then I would try to find the hiring manager there but look you know this one cost uh again less than a penny it's like 8 000 tokens for a penny this costs less than a thousand tokens for a penny and this is a senior manager in finance at Breck in New York according to their LinkedIn profile amazing and so if you are someone who's looking to do you know any kind of research that you kind of do over and over and again the the same exact way this is a great way to do it one thing that I didn't show here that it does really really well is like finding the owners of local businesses that you usually have to go to the website and manually find Ena gymnastics I particularly put them in here because it's a local business and Craig Zappa's name was mentioned in multiple places knowing that he's the owner and the co-owner uh and things like that and so it could be used for that kind of stuff I'm really excited about this one I think everybody should give it a shot but it is in beta right now so I'm not sure how many people are gonna let in because again I don't work there anymore but I hope you enjoy this video and you get as excited as I am about this\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Outlook Office 365 Automatic and Manual Set up for Cold Email

hey everyone I have a pretty highly requested video today where I'm going to go over how to set up uh Microsoft Office 365 or Outlook accounts so that you can start using them for cold emailing we are going to set up accounts manually and then we're going to set up accounts uh with as much automation as possible and so you're looking at the automation here candidly so that I can get a thumbnail um but what we're going to do is we're going to start with setting them up manually so you know the basics and then we can move to the automated way and so the first thing you need to do is you need to buy a domain and so we have this domain right here and we have these DNS settings and everything and so the first thing that we're going to do is now that we have the domain we're looking at the DNS settings uh we're going to go to our Microsoft account and this is our admin panel and I'm just gonna click on admin and then we'll see all of this and the first thing I'm going to type in is I'm just going to go to domains settings and then go to domains and we're going to click add domain and so then we're going to take the domain we want to add and we are going to put it in here and we're going to click use this domain name now I buy everything through GoDaddy and so uh they have their own domain verification inside of GoDaddy so we're going to do that so we're gonna hit verify click on all of this good stuff so now there's a couple of things going on in the back end where the spiff record is being set up uh and the MX records are being set up so we're going to hit continue right to the MX record so know that this is coming from Outlook is being set up and then the spiff record is being set up so we're going to hit add DNS records we'll hit connect again on here and so now we are done and so now we have added our domain now we need to add a user and so we're just going to click over here I didn't see my video great so uh hold on can we get something so now we can add a user and so we're just going to come in and let's see add our user and that'll be the display name and then that'll be our username for this one and then we're not going to use that we're going to use the sales flare one and then we're going to automatically create a password that's totally fine uh require them because I don't want to send password and email code yep great now we're gonna hit next we just finished setting up that user and so now what we need to do is we finish setting up that user we just clicked through everything I thought there was gonna be passwords so I paused the video and now we're going to do the dkm settings and so we're going to go to dkim there we go it's just loading sorry about that and so we're going to go to try sales flare CRM right and so we're going to click on this no da no dkim keys yes I'm aware of that so we're going to create dkim keys and this is where we're going to go back to GoDaddy okay so we have all this information now we're going to go back to GoDaddy so selector one domain key and then we're going to do selector one domain key so now we're going to go to our DNS records and we're going to have a new record pretty sure it's a CNA record yeah it's a senior record so we're gonna hit uh I think we yeah that and so we put selector one domain key and then the value over here and then we're gonna hit add more records and now we're gonna do the second one and so it's just selector two domain key and then that and so then we're gonna do perspective two domain key and then we're gonna do this now we have more records to add so this is a c name and we are also going to add a txt which uh honestly I'm not sure what txt stands for but we're just going to add a D mark while we're at it so we'll do the dmarc policy right now and then we always use custom tracking so we are going to set up our custom tracking domain oh no it's a c name we're going to set up our custom tracking right now as well and we'll hit save all records whoops totally forgot about that great and so now we're updating the DNS settings and so now we've taken care of the whole DNS setting where we now have um the dkim setups the dmarc the spiff the MX records everything's taken care of and we have the open tracking the last thing that we need to do in order to get this ready is we just need to set up forwarding where we're just going to hit add forwarding and we're going to put salesflare.com permanent 301 redirect and then now anytime anybody looks out looks up tryout salesflare crm.com it's going to go to salesflower.com so that is how you do this process manually so what you would have to do is what I would recommend doing is like syncing all of your domains and then creating all of the users and then setting up all your dkm keys dmarc and all of that stuff and then attaching it to your tool like smart lead instantly.ai Apollo whatever you're using to send emails from um now for me that's a lot of clicking and I don't like to do that and so what I've done is I've created this make scenario that does all of this for me so we the here are the manual steps in this workflow so one you have to add the uh domains you must add the domains to your Microsoft account still manually but that's pretty easy you just have to click and just add to GoDaddy and just do all that then you can run this workflow you do have to create the oh actually no I wouldn't run this workflow you need to create the dkim keys uh I'm so sorry actually you don't so sorry for everyone in the video you don't need to create the dkm keys because we're creating the dkm keys here so once you add the domains manually then you're going to run the workflow and then you can go in and create the users and you can do all of that automatically look up like how to do it via CSV and so you'll see we have all of this set up where we have the domain we have the dkm selector and then we say ready to launch so the way that this works is like this is adding the dkim selector and so if we look at it see how if it's pulling from verification B so it's pulling from B over here and if you look at uh whoops if you look at the DNS records every time it's selector one \- tryout sales flare \- com dot it's there's no dots or anything so what we did is we just created the same exact thing where now I have get salesflare.com over here and now I'm pulling it in selector one salesflow \- com dot and then we have all this stuff and then we've got it all set up so this one does selector key one this one does selector key two and then there's just asleep because and propagated and then this one does the dmarc settings and then this one just gets our customer ID and then this one does the forwarding so we're we're all set on these ends and so if I were to take this and do our next one so we're just gonna do uh get salesflare.com on this one so what we could see is if we go to um our domain portfolio and just put actually what I should have done quick little hack if you just change the uh the sales player you just change the url you could go straight to the DNS settings and so you'll see these DNS settings are completely blank right and so now what we're going to do is I'm going to hit go on this and then it's just going to run and it's going to add everything for me and so now it's sleeping I'm going to pause the video to just let it run okay and so now this is it ran that one uh column it went up to 34 here because it was losing its mind with the searches I guess so it ran that one domain so now if we go to that domain and we refresh it notice how everything that we need is completely set up for us inside of the DNS settings so now what I would then do is I would go now I have got all my DNS settings set up you do need to activate the dkm key for some reason so you do need to like if we go back um we'll go to domains right what we didn't do is we didn't add the domain so let's just come in here and we'll add the domain real quick right and so now we're going to finish up the setup because this is going to add the MX records and everything so now we've got to go to the dkim now we're gonna activate this dkm key cool so we'll just do a search oh what maybe it's not here yet uh hang on so here it is then we'll just pull this and we'll just click on it and so then we're gonna say create dkm keys but we've already created these like they're the same every time um on Google they're different every time but for Outlook they're the same every time so then we'll create these and then we'll just hit close and then we'll enable them and so this is a manual step that you're still gonna have to do uh let's see here so this is something that I've seen before and let's just all fix it together so we just need to make sure that the selector key we want to make sure that it's pointing to the exact same thing so let's go fix this what did we miss up so we're going to do selector key one I don't see any difference between these oh maybe it's this xwk and 52j versus that yeah maybe it's that so let's hit save yeah maybe I just need to update my um uh because every time you change panels you need to do this differently so I think I need to just update my workflow which is totally fine we will take care of that save okay great and now we have all of this set up it might take a couple minutes for this to get authenticated we'll just hit OK and we'll hit enable yeah it's going to take a couple of minutes for this to get authenticated because we just added it in but this is basically how you would do all of this and so this is how you would set up Outlook accounts manually and as automatically as possible I'm going to take this make flow for everybody and um I'm going to link it in the sheet I'm going to download this and I'm going to link it in the sheet and I'll make a copy of our email setup template and I'll put that into the sheet as well for anybody watching this video and you want to do something nefarious I'm deleting all these domains so don't you know it's not even worth trying anything to do nefarious with this and uh yeah I hope you all enjoy the video from here\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# How to Build a List of Ecom/CPG Companies

hey everyone in this video I'm going to go over my process of actually building a list for one of our customers at growth nginx and we're going to be sending some outbound emails to them and so this list in particular uh these are the requirements for the list so we're looking for e-commerce companies and consumer package good companies they have to have over 25 employees they have to be consumer packaged Goods or e-commerce their average order value is over forty dollars they're using clavio um or Shopify and these are the industries that they would be in and we have to exclude print-on-demand companies uh as well as Drop Shipping I think okay so there's multiple ways that we can build this list and we're going to go over a couple of them so the I'm going to go from easy to hard slash expensive so the easiest way to get this list done is to start with Apollo um use the technology filter and Industry filters uh push to Clay to do more robust uh data analysis the second way we can do this is we can pull a list with built with plug into Apollo and then push to clay or we can use uh pull list from harmonic follow and so in this video I'm going to go over all of these but before we jump into that I'm just going to explain myself a little bit here so um Apollo when you go to Apollo the technology filter that is built with technology filters I've spoken to the Apollo team it's the same data as built with it just might not be updated as often and so we can kind of cut a corner here and we can do that the more robust data we're gonna have to get from Clay is this average order volume right here um where you have to go to Clay for something like that Apollo is not going to have that data built with this is I would say probably the best way to do this without spending a ton of money is to pull the built with report plug those domains into Apollo filter by the industries and the employees and then do the average order value inside of clay and then uh another great way to do this would be to use harmonic and then jump into Apollo and then go to Clay and so we're gonna just jump into this and we're going to start with number one and so here we go we're going to go to Apollo first Vlog in whoops okay we're already there so uh we're actually just gonna do a people search and so we are looking for CEOs uh for this one uh like the CEOs and the chief marketing officers so I always like to add as many as I possibly can and I'm not going to make you guys watch this I'm going to pause all right so I am done with my filters I did all the job titles we're only looking for people in the United States we did a custom range of 25 to 250 and then our industry and keywords we put in everything over here um and then our Technologies was clavio and Shopify and so now we have our saved list over here which is just a start for us and what we can do is we'll download this and this is a pretty quick and dirty way of getting the this list done um now the biggest problem is we're just at the mercy of what Apollo can give us we don't have any other uh resources that we can use and so like I said quick and dirty but we might need to expand this one day uh if we want to expand it the best way to do it would be to go to built with and pull a report from there so I'm going to jump over and show you that so in built with this is super simple we can you know pull up a list of uh clavio usage and then we can download this lead list we're going to grab that filter it out a little bit and we'll use that so we'll download the full lead list and then it's going to run we're going to download this and then we're going to filter on top of it so I'm just going to show you what this looks like because uh all live clavio sites is going to take a long time Shopify websites in the United States already has this done we're going to hit ignore and so what we're going to do is we're going to do an advanced filter and so we're just going to you know filter this with everything that makes sense you know United States um let's see employees we want minimum 10 and we'll do a thousand as the max and we'll set that and then you can just create a filtered report and we'd be able to use that so what I've already downloaded is I've already downloaded a list of Shopify sites and we're gonna I'm gonna show you how we're gonna go from built with to Apollo and then we'll take all these lists to Clay so give me a second so oftentimes the builds with list comes with a lot of unnecessary data that we don't need and it comes with a ton if you do the CRM export it does a ton of duplicates so in Excel I just de-duplicated everything so we just have this list so you've got a list of 8 319 this is perfect it's ready to go into Apollo um the way I know it's ready to go into Apollo Apollo can handle 10 000 domains being uploaded into it and so uh you know it's under 10 000 so we're good to go so we're gonna keep everything the same um all of the filters are going to stay the same we're gonna keep all of this together but see how I'm gonna like show you how this gets us extra leads maybe it won't get us extra leads but I'm going to show you a difference and so if we add this to a list and we say like um that's Shopify list right so we're going to add this to a list and we're gonna remove this list from the search so we can see how many new people does this process bring in for us oh we have to refresh it so we're gonna see how many new people will this process bring in so we're gonna delete these people great and so now we're going to go to company include exclude list of companies we're going to drop in all the domains we're going to hit save and search and does this bring new people who fit our criteria I'll let it load but in this case it did not find new people for us totally fine we're just going to move on to uh the last flub so I forgot that uh I was only filming my loom in uh this window and I have to open harmonic in a different window so I apologize about that uh maybe I'll do a video another day but a harmonic has a consumer what do they even call it they have a sector literally called consumer goods and so that's a really easy filter to to use here and this would be another way to get this list and so we could do the same exact thing where we would take the list of websites we can bring it over to Apollo and we can actually take off our industry and keywords if we wanted um because whoops how did I do that the reason how did I put in this is a thousand I'm gonna copy that so uh we're just gonna refresh it so uh we can actually take that the industries away because the harmonic search is the one that did the consumer like Goods uh check so we could actually remove that but I just want to see what kind of crossover we might have um that's really not possible but let's just yeah that was mistake just work with them a little bit all right and we'll hit save and search see it says 4936 there's no way that actually happened all right so there's no crossover but let's see what happens when we take away the industry and keywords great and so we have some more leads over here as well and so it looks like actually Apollo got us a large uh way there um and maybe that's just the way we should have done it so anyway now uh we have a list and I'm gonna pull up that list uh the old Apollo list that we did and we're gonna go into clay and figure out the average order value we're gonna go to Clay sign in and so now we're going to make a new table we're gonna upload this and we're gonna take our Apollo list and we're gonna upload it now technically so what we're going to do is we're going to scrape the Google products and we're going to get all the prices from Google products and then from Google products we'll figure out the average of the prices um so let's see econ sample list so technically the best way to do this see how I'm doing this on like a contact level technically the best way to do this would really be to um do it on the company level and then vlookup this in so that we're not wasting credits but I don't know I'm just going to do it this way um so the first thing that we're actually going to do is I want to make sure that these are actually um retail companies so I'm going to go to Ai and I have oh nope I have a preset and let's see is this a retail company I have the preset and we're just going to point this as the SEO description uh and we're going to click this and so what this is going to do is tell us and confirm to us that this is in fact a retail company even though we have a lot of other ways to tell us we just want to make sure that they are a retail company so we're going to hit rate run this and I'm just going to rename this while we have the time and so then we'll do a little bit of a spot check doesn't do retail who is this is on a mission to provide a better cut of meat for every type of eater rooted from Prime ribs is able to replicate The Taste and texture I can see how it missed that but this is a retail company so we're just going to train the AI a little bit more and so we'll take like all of this and we're gonna replace the description great and then we're going to say that and we're going to say does retail great and now we'll hit run again so now over time we just train it on the data why does it still say it doesn't do retail that's crazy anyway I'll be fixing that um but we can run this on the rest of the rows uh and so we'll run this and now we can figure out their average order volume so we're going to go here we're gonna do find no no find Google shopping results great so we're just going to jump in here and we're just going to put the web the actually let's put the company name now let's try that so company name for emails and we'll just put shopping and then we'll hit this and we'll just run the first 10 rows and we'll just get what we need so see how we have all these does retail and everything now we have our results we see our shopping great so we have Prime Roots that's exactly what we're looking for great looks like there's multiple places that we're getting this I wonder if we do it by website and this again I think it's pulling a lot of the the results and probably the first one is like our best one uh who are we even looking at here what company is this Stanberry okay cool standberry so we have the price here let's do another one Stanberry eBay Stanberry so see how we have all of the prices Stanberry so all we're going to do is I'm going to filter I'm going to export the top five prices here and then we're going to make an average so hang on sorry I already like but I'm I'm just going to do the top three because it was enough and so I'm just gonna say what is the average of and then we're just going to map them extracted price and extract the price and extract the price we'll just hit generate formula boom that looks right that looks right that looks right that looks right boom so we'll hit output as correct and we're going to name this aov and if we look back at our sheet this is exactly what we needed so we have the industry we have clavio we have average order volume we have this and we have this we're good to go we built the list and so I hope you enjoyed this deep dive of building a list from scratch\#\# Date Posted:

\# Automatically Pitch Social Media Ideas to Brands with GPT-4

hey everyone in this video we're going to go over a workflow where we are going to find a company's social uh platform link we're going to find a post of theirs and then we're going to send them video ideas that you know ugc creators or something like that mostly a creative marketing campaign is what we're going to be sending for them and so you'd be able to send an email like hey I just saw uh the post about AI generated content um if you're trying to connect with more ugc creators who can make videos like one two three we're going to generate those examples with AI I could connect you with those ugc creators uh just you know give me a shout that's essentially the email that we're trying to send so the first thing that we need to be able to do is we first need their Tick Tock account so in clay there's a tool or an integration called scrape website which one of the outputs is The Tick Tock account it's very easy to set this up you literally just map The Domain make the output Fields the Social Links and then you can get these Tick Tock accounts when we discover them the next thing is we need to set up our Google search and to show you what we're going to do really quick if you go to site oh I actually have it up right now so if we do site ticktock.com backslash fashion Nova backslash of video and we hit go this first link here is a legitimate post that fashion Nova actually posted and so is this one as well they actually posted these and we can call them out on this I think they've posted this one they posted this one CS fashion Nova right there and maybe we can even put like June in here to make this a little bit better yeah so this is one of their recent posts uh about this and so now what we can do is we have the Google search here that we're going to be using to put this together so when you use cite colon that means I want you to return results from Google but I only want them to be with this link inside of them and then June is just to make sure that they actually posted it pretty recently and so we're gonna do that so we're gonna create this Google Search the first thing we need to create this Google Search though is we need to kill this URL and or I mean shorten it see that says https and then backslash www dot and then ticktock.com all of that is going to make our site search a little uh inaccurate so we're going to map the whoops we're going to map this Tick Tock and we're going to make it bare oh actually that might take it too far hold on yeah this might take it too far nope perfect this is exactly what we want okay great so now we'll create the Google search so we'll go here we'll create our Google search so same thing site backslash but now we're going to hit backslash so that we can map everything in here just like an Excel formula so then we'll put the normalized URL in here and then we're going to put June oh this normalized URL only includes at complex so we need to put backslash video right after this too so it matches perfectly and then we'll just put June and so now this same Google search that we did over here is this Google Search now so we'll hit continue to add fields and we'll run the first 10 rows and now we're going to get uh some of the recent posts and we're going to get the snippet from their recent posts so let's grab this here and so see how we have the snippet here so Kylie Jenner's summer Staples tinted butter bomb in shade yeah whatever um we're gonna get another one our summer lip balm Obsession new tinted blah blah blah yeah okay then we go to this one fashion trend spring outfit summer outfit fashion trends cargo pants baggy pants yeah great and then summer 21 in full effect we're feeling oh that's so funny they're like doing a throwback there I guess uh okay you mean yeah we shouldn't do fashion Nova for a YouTube video uh bodybuilding.com this is way better okay discover your ultimate summer flavor beat the heat and so now what we can do is we can take all of those Snippets and we can write AI generated lines about them so we're going to take action on this list and we're gonna filter this out and so what I want is return all of the snippet text from this list into one cell and so then we'll hit generate formula because what I'm going to do is we have all these Snippets right oh how did that not work we have all these Snippets and I want all the Snippets to be in one spot um the generate formula great so now we have all of these Snippets all in here and we're gonna post and we're gonna put that in artificial intelligence to say hey I was looking at your Tick Tock page Vogue like maybe we'll send them the link I don't know and then we can say I see that you often post about blah blah blah and we'll we'll make those AI generated lines and then we'll do the ugc Creator content one uh output is correct say formula so now we have this and so now the next thing that we're going to do is now that it's all much easier for us to use is we're going to use AI so we're going to jump in here and we're going to write our prompt using the input uh summarize what a tick tock account usually posts about and complete my sentence this is the input and then we're going to grab it from here so we're gonna go that's the input formula I'm going to put it in quotes So AI knows what we're talking about and then we're going to say uh keep the output under eight words and uh use keywords from the input make sure to summarize the text with what this Tick Tock account usually posts about complete each output with my prefix this is my prefix great now we're going to say I saw your Tick Tock account and noticed you post about and then blah blah now we're going to add the examples in here so we're going to add some examples and this is this is how we're going to really increase the accuracy of what it's going to say because we can actually show it you know when you see this text you should say this so we'll go to we're not doing fashion Nova again there's no so we're going to go here and then we're going to say all right let's read this a little bit um so they're doing a lot of like celebrity call outs and things like that so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna say I saw your Tick Tock uh and notice you post about celebrity uh collaborations with uh uh Vogue right and so then we're gonna call this out oh whoops is that even how you spell collaborations whatever now we're going to do it again so that we're just training AI on what we want because we're going to send these straight away in an email and I don't want to check them so we want to give a lot of examples so AI makes a good decision about what to say we'll have bodybuilding.com what are we going to do here so we put the formula in here ultimates beat the heat with cool supplements how do you stick to your diet through the summer great so same thing we're going to say I saw your Tick Tock and notice you post about supplement tips uh and getting ads for the summer great and so we can put this in here and then we can hit continue to add Fields we'll map the content and then we can get AI to talk about what this company posts about so this doesn't matter because this isn't Tick Tock this is these are the only ones that really matter because we got their Tick Tock Pages let's get some more let's get some more ones going so now let's check the ones where we already inputted what we wanted it to say so I noticed you post about Vogue fashion events and cover features great that's awesome uh so I took that to notice you post about Kylie Jenner's summer because my Cosmetics perfect and so you noticed a post about social calendar events and content ideas oh that's wrong uh but this isn't a tick tock page that's totally fine notice you post about Fitness diet and supplements awesome sorry Tick Tock and notice you posted about NBA player trades and Summer League highlights who's this for great great okay so now this would be the first sentence in the email and now we're going to give them more post ideas and so this is exactly how we're gonna do it we'll go to use AI you know what I might what we're going to do here too is I'm going to get the description of the company too so that that can help us run some better uh data on these people so here let's do this and so what I mean by that is um now that we'll have the description we can we can feed AI some more stuff so we're gonna hit use AI again and I'm going to say using the inputs create three video ideas that um user generated content creators would be able to build on behalf of the brand the input inputs I'm going to give you include the description of the company and uh captions of some of their recent posts this is the description of the company open in quotes and so we'll grab the description cool this is some captions of their recent post I know I'm Flying Blind there so then we'll hit this whoops and we're just going to take we're going to use that formula again so let's use the formula boom right now uh keep the output to just three sentences and send creative ideas oh and output creative ideas for the brand to imagine what creators can post on there be half and so now here it's going to be super important that we give examples because uh there's no prefix for this and we we kind of gotta like let it run so we're going to give tons of examples here so first we'll have um oh we don't have the description whoops uh we're gonna guess our Vogue is a fashion brand for women we're just gonna give it that it's not like we're we're just gonna work off of a pretty simple one and so then what we're going to say is and now you have to come up with the ones on your own so I would say um definitely doing bodybuilding.com next time I don't know uh okay so now we're definitely doing bodybuilding.com I have no clue about this one uh let's do this again so then we're just going to say usually I would copy and paste this but I would have to close it and stuff so that's why I'm uh news advice to men and women wow out those teens diets and supplements to get them in the best shape of their life okay great and then recent captions we'll take the recent wow bodybuilding.com gets 31 likes on their tick tocks oh that one did well okay interesting right so what did I do ugc content and so hopefully you see like the importance is is writing out examples so that these so that AI knows what you want it to say because otherwise it's not going to know um could help the body building .com brand bye doing the workouts posted on the website and results it could also show off creating a video that was posted on the recipe website finally content creators would be incentivized to show there before and after photos showing the end m impact bodybuilding.com has had on and there lives now we have these examples filled out let's continue to add fields and so now this is going to complete what we want to be able to do so if you are a ugc content creator or you are a um company that helps connect with them or you're just here because you just wanted to see some more AI prompt workflows this is exactly how I'd send an email where I'd basically say hey I saw your tick tock tick tock account and you post about these kinds of things and we'd personalize that and then you know I have them imagine how we would be able to help their brand and how uh we could give them ideas based off of this as well and so you know let's review a couple of these so we're definitely not doing fashion Nova uh let's do complex uh can create and post videos showing their summer hangout wearing the Brand's latest sneakers and styling ideas they can create a reaction video uh on the latest music hits commenting on the impact of the song On Pop Culture additionally they could share a day in the life as an intern at a pop culture company detailing their experiences what does this company do what was this complex what is complex oh oh it's a pop culture thing oh okay McCormick oh let's see if we got one for this one I usually see creators could support McCormick's price this is brand by creating spin-off recipe videos and using McCormick products awesome they could also post holiday themes food Creations awesome is for the contents here to host virtual cook-offs or baking challenges using McCormick sprays is creating a sense of community offer not bad that's really really good let's do one more not that one let's do who is this nope not complex we did bodybuilding.com I gave it that one oh you got some more popping up over here is this who is this Steve Madden okay Steve Madden let's see what we said for Steve Madden content creators could show themselves unboxing Steve Madden products on sharing their first impressions of the design and quality they could also create a lookbook video featuring Steve Madden accessories and Handbags awesome and other ideas for Content creators to document their shopping experience with Steve Madden pass wow that's awesome great okay and so I hope you enjoyed this video where instead of I just walk through it really fast of how I did it I built it live and uh you know I hope you learned something from this thanks for watching\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Fully Automating a 5.1% Positive Response Cold Email Campaign 🚀

in this video I'm going to go over how we created a 5.1 fully automated positive response rate campaign all this takes is some LinkedIn data and then we do a lot of filtering in order to get the leads listed we are going to start off by going through the copywriting that we're using and then I will show you the clay table that makes all this happen this is a campaign that we ran for clay.com using clay.com and I can't wait for you to see it so the first thing that we're going to do is like I said go over the copywriting so this is email one subject line outbound Edge I was on your site and it looks like you sell to job titles um and so we use AI to generate who they sell to and it looks like you are trying to help we actually changed this uh it looked like you are helping and then we have the AI generation there I had to assume you're using outband tactics considering full name of SDR is an SDR bdr on the team we actually if they call them bdrs we say bdr if we they call them sdrs we say sdrs uh then are you thinking about how they could be leveraging better data and GP gpt4 to do their prospecting the reason I ask is because we're helping companies like Rippling and ramp with our tool that collects the data and writes the messages messaging for them uh would this be worth a chat to build a custom outbound table for you so that is email one we have one two three four levels of personalization in there and then we get into email two as you're helping people and then we are putting in information about the company I'd imagine you're using outbound marketing tactics like the following then we're using some creative ideas of what they are probably doing and then I'm asking have you cracked how to do this Persona targeting and data enrichment automatically or is your team still using tools like sales nav to do a manual research if so would it be worth taking some time to show you how you can automate Persona and account research for your outbound team awesome so email three uh this is coming a while later I like to space out my emails a lot subject line Show and Tell I send an email a while back with the subject outbound Edge that probably didn't get do a good enough Job showing you how we could help your outbound team our tool combines over 40 databases it's one spreadsheet so your team can see all the data in front of them instead of manually researching accounts for example at your company looks like your sales team has seen a percentage change in the past three months your LinkedIn company account has gained this many followers in the past three months and the company looks like it has number of sales people or well we'll say like 55 uh oh we change that people with sales in their title based in the United States today besides cute things like this we also monitor for recent news open jobs positions tech on site and uh mentioned in job descriptions and a lot more on a call we could build a custom workflow for your team to Auto uh oh we want to make it happen whoops we and this did not go through proofreading before we put into the campaign the campaign didn't look like this so then email for perhaps this is not your area of focus should I potentially reach out to another person on the team who is in the sales and marketing department that is not them we want to make sure we're not saying their name I don't want to say you know should I potentially reach out to Eric nostalaski and I'm sending an email to Eric nostalaski given their role as a job title cleaned with AI so if I have uh at least gotten your attention enough where this is a campaign that you would want to build we used clay to do the entire thing and so we did not send exactly to this list because I didn't want to post the list because some of you nerds are probably going to go try to hunt these people down or something so this is all just sample data and so we imported the sample data and we just do a couple of simple things as you've seen in my other videos first thing we have to do is we have to verify the email addresses to see if they are legit to send to and then we use find work email to expand our list even more and then we generate a master email column for ourselves and then we normalize the company name so we're not reaching out to people with like crazy um names in in them yeah and so after we have a valid email address to send to we conditionally run the enriched company to uh run so that we could get their company description so this is clearstreet clear street is building Financial infrastructure for today's institutions clients all sizes are use our clearing custody execution and primary brokerage platform all this stuff yeah something about financial assets great really long good description what we then do is we use artificial intelligence to be able to figure out who do they sell to and so this is a little bit what the prompt uh looks like if it will open up using the input what types of people or specific job titles would a company sell to this is the input output who gets the most value or product of the service add specific job titles or a type of person return up to three job titles do not include any numbers or extra information an example would look like this VPS or sales and two like all that stuff right and so they sell to CEO CFOs and chief investment officers they sell to content creators filmmakers and video editors yep it's a video first content platform what is class do probably this is already right educational software binary class ads teaching and learning tools to zoom great instructors teachers and Educators awesome that would be a great line to put out there Market leading Global partner for future proof logistic process automation you sell to Warehouse managers as Logistics directors and Airport operations let's see where do they mention Airport it's usually pretty good oh I saw baggage yep airport Solutions awesome so then we got some really great lines right here so this is fulfilling this first part of looks like you sell to these job titles and it looks like you're helping modernize Financial infrastructure that's exactly what that company is doing it looks like you're helping creators tell stories and Inspire audiences exactly what they're doing uh you enhance virtual classrooms on Zoom exactly what they're doing so then it looks like you're helping boom boom boom right there so all of that work just creates this first awesome line right here and then what we do is we go to find uh the SDR or bdr on the team so we're using a find people enrichment over here and then we're on getting their SDR or bdr on the team and then we have this formula right here and let's dig into this where we're literally saying if this title of people contains sales then this sale equals to SDR and if this title contains business then this cell equals to bdr so that you know because if you reach out to a company and you say you have sdrs they don't love it um and so then like here we didn't get the right person so this is account development representative we could have probably redone this flow to to make this just say an SDR because that would have been totally fine but um yeah so sometimes they're like oh look we have sdrs we don't have bdrs that's like fine whatever like so we just have to include that in the message there and so then that would be the oh and of course we get their full name so I can reach out to them and I can reach out to Paula and I can say like Kelly bowling is a SDR on your team like and I know that you're using outbound tactics and then we've completed all of the personalizations we need for that email and so then we're gonna go into as you're helping people AI generation I just love just like personalizing by that I think it makes the email look super super clean as you're helping people enhance virtual classroom experiences I'd imagine you're using outband marketing tactics like the following right as you're helping people manage Global Employment Solutions I'd imagine you're using outbound tactics like the following as you're helping oh we already went over that one as you're helping people secure manage and transform digital operations I'd imagine you're doing these kinds of things notice how we didn't get the other one to run over here because we couldn't find an SDR at these companies and if they don't have an SDR I don't even want to reach out to them um I fully believe that cold email is what it's missing is not only is like too many people are trying to like personalize and then spray and pray to everybody look if they don't have an SDR team I don't even want to reach out to them and like if we can't find one SDR then let's not even email them I want every single person who receives this email to get a super super awesome uh campaign from us so that's why it drops off over here and so then now we can say as you're helping people enhance virtual classroom experiences I'd imagine using outbound marketing tactics like the following and then we put in our creative ideas you're targeting School principles and district manager administrators highlighting streamlined remote learning with class tools on Zoom you're reaching out to University Educators showcasing class for Effective higher education virtual classrooms and lectures you're connecting with professional trainers offering online courses promoting classes productivity and engagement tools for learning so awesome it's like going over like these are probably the things that you're doing and having your SDR doing and then I'm challenging them and I'm saying have you cracked how to do this Persona targeting and data enrichment automatically or is your team still using tools like sales to have to do the manual research right like hitting them right there of like look I know all these things about you but are you doing it automatically look how great our email is at doing this automatically and then we fulfilled everything that we need for uh this email this uh one right here we just try to get as much data from one platform as we can so that we keep it all the same and so we used harmonic a harmonic integration for this one and so uh if we get a sales growth percentage we just normalize it because harmonica gives it to us by like 7.48 or something like that and then that we also get the LinkedIn company follower uh increase in percentage over here and so then we just normalize that down so that we have the sales growth percentage and we have the clean LinkedIn followers so this is sales growth and this is LinkedIn company account and then we go for the number of sales people for the number of sales people at the company we just use get employee headcount by title this is a really great integration inside of um clay and so it's literally just sales in the United States exactly uh what I told them that I'm searching for right here is what we're searching for over here and so then we get the number of this and so you can see that like I only have like 60 rows in here and we would only send this campaign to like uh we would still send this campaign without this person so we would only send this campaign to one person out of this this whole group which I mean a lot of people are like oh you must be like throwing away a lot of data I'm like nope like I just want to be sending perfect emails to people if they don't qualify in to all four emails we'll worry about that later and we can contact them in a different way I want them to perfectly sift into this email um and so then I call ourselves out I'm like besides cute things like this we can do all this you know just more of a hook okay great and then this is how we make this last line happen should I potentially reach out to other sales and marketing person in the company that's not them given their role as job title cleaned with AI so then what we do here is I want to find other uh sales and marketing people at the company so we have all of these titles for other sales and marketing people at the company I want to exclude representative development or engineer because we don't really want like sales Engineers or um other sdrs and so then this person is Sophie Jones director of demand generation and when we clean it it still turns out to be director of demand generation if we were to go in here and I were to say like CEO world changer right like this should Oh Why didn't it run maybe this is dependent on other things huh I wonder what this is dependent on actually oh it's dependent on on an email being filled out so okay that's not gonna work right now but then anyway we do a get keywords filter over here to ensure that Sophie Jones is not the same person that we're reaching out to uh so 19 so we're reaching out to Scott and I'm like hey Scott so you know he's the associate vice president of the National Health Plans you know should I be reaching out to the director of demand generation and that's how we fulfill all of these emails you know I see a lot of people talking about personalization and relevance and everything but they're dumping all of it into their first email and then the rest of their emails to be quite honest are a little bit annoying I'm guilty of this as well I know but uh we want to keep moving up as much as we possibly can so uh yeah with my knowledge of clay we were able to put this table together in about an hour after we came up with what we wanted to say for these people and uh as you can see the results really speak for themselves on this this is the screenshot from the campaign directly from the the sequencing tool and uh yeah as always if anyone has any questions about this campaign or you just want to find out more about how we do this uh reach out leave a comment on this YouTube video or happy to talk with anybody on LinkedIn uh have a great day everyone\#\# Date Posted: 2023-03-01

\# Review of Apollo.io

hey everyone in this video I am going to go over the Apollo platform why it is my go-to whenever asked whenever I'm asked about what databases to be purchasing and where is the best prospecting database and all those kinds of things I think the Apollo database is absolutely phenomenal and it's my go-to for a lot of reasons one of the main reasons that it's my go-to is because when you compare the coverage to what you would get on a LinkedIn search it's very very similar so if you're looking for say a list of property managers on LinkedIn you might get 50 000 results on Apollo you might get 40 000 which actually I like Apollo search even better because on LinkedIn if you look through the property managers you'll start finding like uh people who who should not be on that list at all and Apollo search is a little bit tighter um so the refinement of their job titles is awesome um then when you compare this to other Marketplace Solutions like lead IQ or seamless or some of the other ones like icy leads or things like that Apollo just comes up with phenomenal coverage so that is one of my biggest reasons that I love using Apollo the other reasons that I love using Apollo is for how easy it is to take a list of companies and then find job titles at those companies so we're going to go over these filters later but one of my absolutely favorite things to do is to jump in and grab the the uh a list of companies throw them into Apollo and then find every product manager at the company phenomenal uh platform there and then I love using the keywords as well so not only can you sort companies by industry and keyword you can also start with them uh by well like I said those keywords and so then oh the other thing I'd like to mention is the more filters tab there's just some amazing filters that you can look at in here including employees by Department uh total number of employees of course a lot of databases have that employees by department is pretty special um buying intent I say away from a little bit I'm I'm sure there's a good use case but we don't use that we're building lists to find our own intent uh funding rounds is of course great retail locations is one you don't get in a lot of places job postings is pretty good but we're going to talk about the drawbacks of that later uh total years of experience very interesting one interesting one years in current role also very interesting time and current role very interesting as well and so these between years in current role time in current role and then employees by Department those are some advanced settings that I think are really really awesome that are included in Apollo so without much more let's get into a couple of my favorite use cases for Apollo so probably one of my favorite things that you're able to do is this import setting over here so you can either import contacts or if you were to go to companies you can import companies and so if we do a bulk import we'll select a CSV and I'm just picking a CSV right now and so what we can do is we can bulk import a CSV which usually we'll use as a whole Target addressable market and maybe we grabbed it from harmonic maybe we grabbed it from crunchbase maybe we scrape the list wherever it might have come from what we can do is we can upload the file into here and then we can map it and then we can you know find contacts that those companies really easily so the list that I uploaded is taking a while because I uploaded over 55 000 accounts that we will be finding Learning and Development leaders at and Apollo makes this really really simple to be able to do so this is the UI that you get when you have successfully uploaded the list and so like I said I have 54 000 rows whoops I have 54 000 rows that I wanted to upload and I only use the account website because that took a while and it would have taken even longer if I didn't do that account website is actually all that you need it will find everything for you and actually another one of my favorite Parts about Apollo is they even have this uh button here where you can intelligently infer a website for rows with only account names and no websites so if you want to upload a list of uh companies the account website is going to be 100 needed but if you don't have the account websites they can find a lot of the account websites for you too and uh roughly five percent of Errors I've found that to be the case as well and we just filter them out by making sure that every company that we uploaded either matches the industry that we wanted or we just kind of rechecked the list so I'm going to add this to a list and I'm going to call it a Glassdoor 3.0 to 3.9 and we're going to do that and now we're going to import this and we're just going to wait for this to import so we can move on to the next step so now the upload has completed and you'll see that we only have 10 000 companies here because Apollo splits up the list into 10 000 company lists so if you just go to more filters and you go to account CSV import and then you add all of your companies there you'll see we had fifty thousand fifty three thousand companies which means we matched I would say you know 98 of all the companies in here and so now we have all of these companies that fit only one criteria the only criteria that they fit is they have a 3.0 to a 3.9 Glassdoor rating now I'm going to jump in here and I will first tailor them by the United States cuts out about half the list there and then we're also going to refine it to under 200 employees and now we have a list of 18 000 companies that fit these parameters so what I can do at this point is I can further refine my search or I can start finding people so at this point what I like to do is I like to save my search and I'll call it like Glassdoor 3.0 to 3.9 um us under 200 employees and I don't want an email subscription from it so I'm going to save the search and the reason that we're going to do this is I want all these parameters to be saved but if you try to find all of these people so if we go in and we select all companies oh actually we want to do it from saved so sorry if we try to select all of these companies and then we hit find people it's going to overload the Apollo system and they're not going to let us do it so what we found is we actually want about 5 000 companies per search when we try to find people so now what we've done is we've just gone back and I refined the search to one through ten employees we could actually add probably 11 to 20 and get away with it as well like I said the most that they'll let you do is about 5000 at a time that 21 to 50 would definitely break it though so now we have about 3 500 companies that we're going to be searching for so we're going to select all companies and then we'll hit find people and now we can find all of the people Associated at the company that fits our job title search now the job title search that they have in Apollo is phenomenal you can either do this based off of the exact keyword that you're looking for which I usually find works best if you're trying to find the top decision maker at the company these things these uh titles are usually the best to put in CEO chief executive officer you know those kinds of things um owner president founder all of these are great things to be typing in um so this part is awesome the job titles is great look we inputted you know what was it 3 400 companies there's a total of 3.8 companies here what I also love about Apollo is that the saved contacts are in here so if I've ever found them before I could just jump in and save them and pull them right out now if we're not looking for the top decision maker at the company another great feature is that they have the choice of the management level which we can come in here and we can select all the management levels that we would like to pick and then we can pick the Department's and job function and so say we're looking for product managers we can just open up engineering and Technical and find product management and anybody who fits that product management now this list seems low because we're using these types of roles but if we take out those job titles now here all the companies that have product managers uh uh in their company which these aren't all tech companies that's why it probably is a little low maybe if we change it and we'll take this one away and let's add Finance right so we want everybody who's leading the finance department at these companies and great so now we have a list of all the people who are leading the finance department at these companies and they are you know in these positions then it's super easy to just jump in and select the people now I'm on the Enterprise plan so I can select all of these people but I know uh for most people watching this you would have to select just the page one at a time um and so then you would just move through this and you know get your list completely done so that is one of my favorite ways when we're importing a gigantic gigantic list of companies the other thing that if we're not importing a gigantic list of companies that we'll do and this is probably even more of my favorite thing to do is you can copy and paste so let's take away all these filters one of my favorite favorite things that you can do is you can copy and paste and include exclude list of companies so you can just copy and paste companies in here save your search and then immediately start finding people who match these companies uh over here which now I showed you the bulk example because we needed to copy and paste 54 000 companies and this accepts uh they say it accepts 10 000 but it really accepts more like 8 000 people in here um or 8 000 companies into this search over here and so we weren't going to get 54 000 in here but that's how you manage those bulk bulk searches um and then another one of my favorites is the fact that if you enter an exclude list of companies the exclude list will beat out the include list so if you have a do not contact list and you're not sure if there's any duplicates on the do not contact list and on the include list the do not contact list will win out over the include list which is something that I've tested and I really really like the fact that they do um and so those are some yeah I think the only other thing I wanted to cover was just some of the company keywords if you look at the keywords over here they have a lot of them listed and see all of these keywords that they have listed there's sometimes uh some companies that would be really tough to find if you were doing it on your own but the company keywords makes it really easy so for instance it's very difficult to find SAS companies because if you are an HR recruiting SAS company you're gonna say that you're a staffing and recruiting company they won't say necessarily that they're a SAS company so oftentimes we'll put in uh SAS or software uh software might be a little bit too much but anyway what I like to put in is these kinds of keywords and so now we have all of these different kinds of companies which if you just click on the company's tab we'll just open that right up we have all these companies that in their keywords they mention SAS uh inside oh wait no yep so they mentioned SAS inside of their keywords which is really really good to be able to start creating these lists because you know some of these harder to find people can do that sometimes we'll even do it for you know if you're reaching out to lawyers and you want to know the ones that mention wrongful termination that's another one that you'd be able to do that Apollo has some really good keywords on so if we put in you know wrongful termination which also makes your Outreach so much better because you can go through all of these lawyers and you could say hey looks like you know on your website you mentioned wrongful termination we help with a certain type of uh you know problem that I know that you're facing because you deal with wrongful termination you know those kinds of things before we end the video um I just wanted to go over a couple of the drawbacks that I see with Apollo so one of the things that I don't really like is it's kind of a blessing and a curse that you have such a awesome list of saved contacts what I love about the list of saved contacts is we can go into uh the sometimes we'll have companies that want let's see you know something we get asked for all the time is companies that are using Shopify and I want the top decision makers at companies that are using Shopify so sometimes we'll get a new client who comes in and then boom we already have 23 000 saved leads that are ready to go the drawback is if you see these 879 new job changes so on the Enterprise plan I can see this and I was testing this what is kind of annoying is so you know let's see Jason is the founder and CEO of crumble cookies right and if he were to change his job even though I'm searching for any company that's using Shopify to my knowledge and I've tested this if somebody at Apollo wants to correct me I'd be happy to listen to it even if they change jobs it's like their LinkedIn profile is the thing that you need to re-save and you need to update so even though they might have changed jobs they're not going to populate on your Apollo database because you've already saved them in one section and now you have to update it and save it again which I really am not a huge fan of obviously job Changers is not a huge problem for me right now because you know we're still saving the list and there's 250 million leads to save an Apollo and so I guess if we were to pull this down I think at any given time we have like 10 of our list has changed jobs so we have 1.6 million saves and we have 140 000 that change jobs so it's less than 10 percent of the list has changed jobs but it's certainly something that we're going to have to clean up our database with in the future uh mobile numbers are extra in Apollo which that's usually fine every platform usually they're extra in if you want a database with a lot of mobile numbers and you pay a flat fee for it I would recommend seamless in this case um not as much accuracy but the amount of credits that you can get for you know the monthly price that they're going to charge you is fantastic on that as well and then the final thing I would just want to say is sometimes the data isn't a hundred percent accurate um so if we were to say go into job postings right we just want to look for anyone who's hiring for a marketing role sometimes if you look through these and I'm not going to manually do this right now but yeah you can if you have an Apollo account sometimes if you manually search through these you'll go to the company LinkedIn pages and they're not hiring for that role or they're hiring for that role but then you don't get to know exactly what role that they're hiring for or the other thing that's kind of annoying is say we go to visa and we see job postings the most amount of job postings that they'll show you is 10\. and I know for a fact Visa has way more job postings than these just 10 job postings over here so that's a little bit of a drawback on their job posting data but overall I think Apollo is a phenomenal platform pretty soon I will be creating a video on how to use Apollo in a way that they completely let you use but you can get access to a lot more credits then they'll usually let you have and I'll be making a YouTube video about that pretty soon so if you want to follow around for that one I'll be posting pretty soon so make sure you subscribe to the channel to get that update and with that that is my overall overview of Apollo and if anyone has any questions you can just reach out in the comments hope you enjoy\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Growth Engine X Outbound Cold Email Course Intro

hey everyone thank you so much for taking the time to look through this course that I'm about to create this is just our intro video where I just wanted to welcome you and thank you for you know taking the time I I know that your time is valuable and so I really appreciate it so to start off I just wanted to have a quick introduction my name is Eric noski I run an agency called growth engine X where we send about a million cold emails a month on behalf of our customers and uh I've been running it at this point for over two years and in that time I have run countless campaigns on behalf of our customers and I think we've learned a thing or two uh about cold email and outbound that I wanted to share through the overall Network I get tons and tons of questions all the time people ask me for coaching and I just don't have enough time to get it to everybody so I wanted to launch this course so that I'd be able to disperse as much knowledge as we possibly can because my real mission is to make outbound something that if you're going to do it you can do it with a best-in-class system at every company no matter you know your budget your current knowledge whatever it might be so that's a little bit about me this course is going to aim to cover spec outbound marketing specifically with cold email a lot of the strategies a lot of the techniques a lot of the list building that we're going to go over is still going to be relevant if you run cold calling campaigns Direct Mail campaigns LinkedIn direct DM campaigns and things like that personally I run a cold email agency because it's the most scalable for me it uh allows us to talk to the most amount of contacts without losing somebody's LinkedIn account and and managing those kinds of bands and things like that and so that's um what I focused on in my past and that's going to be the focus of this course I do not pretend to be an expert in anything this course is going to go over a lot of my own experiences things that we've tried that's worked things that we've tried that doesn't work I'm upfront with everyone here including uh my customers from the past where I tell everybody look our email infrastructure that we're going to go over is not proprietary if you uh go to a website like instantly AI or smart lead. and you check out their docs about how to set up inboxes and how to set up an email infastructure it's very much going to be the same thing that we do we you know we're not Game Changer in in that realm when it comes to the copyrighting of campaigns I'm going to be giving my thoughts I'm going to be giving things that work but I think there are far better copywriters out in the world we will cover that in this course because you know to run a cold email course we just have to cover that but I am not saying that I'm an expert in those things what I uh want to bring to the table and what I want to give to the community uh if if I can make this course great enough to add to the Canon of outbound and cold email is what I've learned specifically around custom data scraping data enrichment data workflows Automation and artificial intelligence that is is what we have focused on with most of our customers in the past specifically year like when chat GPT 3.5 came out that was a game changer for our business and four was even better and so in this uh in this course I will be covering all of the other things um but you know if you say like hey you know I found this email infrastructure on these websites great I I'm it's not mine I I got it from them as well and when it comes to copywriting if for some reason you disagree with the way I do copywriting please test it that that's all that cold email is it's say always a test and we always want to see what's working the best for us and so now um to get into like who this course is for I think that this course is for B2B Founders who want to create a predictable pipeline of Revenue into their business and outbound is a good fit for them so let's first talk about outbound as as a good fit so we've run a lot of different campaigns and we've learned who outbound is for and who outbound is is really tough for and so a industry that comes to mind that I have not been able to crack with outbound is cyber security cyber security is really tough to crack with outbound I we we have done crazy things like look at the open ports and the vulnerabilities of websites and then email people offering to fix it for free and then relating it to a cyber security incident that happened in their area in their industry and we still couldn't get great responses it was really tough and and my hypothesis there is that when people have a cyber security problem what they do is they they then go find a cyber SEC company people aren't just all the time thinking about cyber security so that's one instance of where outbound is tough another instance of outbound being tough is when you're a b Toc company uh if you're selling shampoo it's very very difficult to sell shampoo to an end user but what you could use outbound for is in order to get into the distributors or find Affiliates and and those kinds of things and so then that could work and so um yeah outbound it like really works when you're a B2B company your LTV of your customers is over $5,000 a year and um you know you can Target them pretty easily by building these kinds of lists and so um who this course is particularly for um is the person we will go over the basics of running cold email campaigns and you will be able to go from never launching a cold email campaign to launching your first one what I will say though is I think there are a lot of courses that cover that and my attempt here is to go beyond just that coverage of launching your first campaign and I want to teach you the tools and the skills to enable really custom amazing outbound campaigns um to go from a regular outbound campaign to a best-in-class outbound campaign in my opinion is not is not that difficult and the reason I say that and I mean I know I'm an agency owner and I'm supposed to keep up this facade that it's you know the the most difficult thing in the world I have seen B2B SAS companies that have a brand of running the best outbound system in Venture back SAS and when I jumped into it to be honest it was not that impressive and so I think going from average to the top 5% is not that difficult to go from the top 5% to the top 1% is really really difficult and what I want to try to do is to try to take you from average to 5% and then hopefully if I do my job right in this course to take you from from the top 5% to the top 1% and so that is my goal and when I'm trying to accomplish this the way that this course will be structured and I have my table of contents over here is so this is the introduction and then we're going to go into things to consider before you're running an outbound campaign things to prepare things to get ready with and all that kind of jazz we'll jump into the email infrastructure all the dos and don'ts the things that we haven't um the the things that we suggest the things that we don't suggest all of those things then we'll go into data collection on the basics of how to build your list we'll go over some basics of copywriting the basics of the way that I think about launching cold email campaigns then we're going to make a pit stop and we're going to do a campaign right then and there where we're going to go over you know now that we've put all these things together how do you launch your first campaign then we'll get into advanced list building where we'll be working with tools like clay.com we'll do some uh we'll work with some scraping tools and some custom scraping tools and then we'll use you know some other low code um Automation and and we're going to talk about how to read API docs because I truly believe you as a salesperson it is your responsibility to learn how to use no Code and low code tools because they're going to make your workflows so so much better we're going to cover my thoughts on artificial intelligence and how we put them into our own campaigns and then I have I think this is going to be the best you know most interesting thing for everybody I have about 35 standard playbooks that we oftentimes pull out for our customers and we just say hey this is the Playbook we're going to use I think this is going to be a good one um and I'm going to go over 35 and how we make those those playbooks happen and then we're going to go over just some fun stuff and then we'll go over a couple of like how to analyze their campaigns how to follow up with positive responses thoughts on scaling volume and those kinds of things so if that's exciting for you keep going with the rest of the course I really hope uh you enjoy it and I can accomplish my mission of giving back to the community that was so great to me by adding to the overall Cannon of outbound and you know the best in ways to run campaigns\#\# Date Posted: 2025-01-01

\# Growth Engine X Data Pipeline SOPs

hey everyone I wanted to publish a internal document that we use at growth engine X that I wanted to share with everybody else and it goes over a lot of clay templates and use cases that we use but also it just goes over like our normal just data infrastructure as well too and so if you are trying to put together your own outbound campaigns a lot of times there's so many tools to choose from it could be hard to pick uh which one you're going to go with and so uh this is how I teach my team how we Source contacts and how we enrich contacts and I hope it's useful for you as well I'll post the uh the document in the comments and just one thing is you'll notice that we have shared tables here I do this so that you can use the exact same clay table that we have uh in our clay account you can just click on this shared table and then you can add it to your clay account and then you can follow this on how to turn it into a recipe so that you could use it in your clay clay account as well too so without further Ado Let's uh jump into it and so I would say our normal data pipeline for most of our customers is we are normally sourcing the data from uh Apollo and then we're using clay as kind of our operating system and our uh enrichment platform and then we're sending the campaigns through smart lead or instantly or whatever it might be uh and so that's generally the the case now the reason why we use Apollo is because for a long time Clay's LinkedIn uh sourcing data wasn't as good as Apollo's and today I feel like it goes back and forth sometimes Apollo has a better search and sometimes clay has a better search really it's it's very easy for us to just keep track of this is a customer's Tam this is the Tam we've already used this is the Tam we haven't used already you know and we've already put it into a clay table let's grab more so that's the main reason that we use Apollo we are current L considering maybe not using Apollo and then just using clay for everything but from a workflow perspective it's not there yet and we just need to evaluate that but I would say for the most part we're doing this workflow here and then you could see uh I made this shared table here this can take a CSV export from Apollo and then it runs it through email cleaning name cleaning company name cleaning and then it's got like a smart lead integration at the end it's just the template that we just use to start all of our uh campaigns we use that template we just make a copy of it and then we um we get building on our clay tables and so then the other thing I just wanted to show and I'm not sure how I can really show this is that yeah it's a little small I I'm sorry the other times that our data pipeline will change is if the thing that we need to Source about the list has changed and so we will still use a follow but sometimes we will use we'll like get a list of Shopify stores from builtwith and then we'll take those domains upload those domains to Apollo and then find contacts in Apollo or we'll build a lookalike list using Ocean or we'll use the SAS filter in crunch base or we'll use Panda match to build a list or we manually scrape things or we use store leads whatever it might be we always take those domains and then we find the contacts in Apollo and so then we just either we include it as a list of companies uh by domain over here or you could also just import the accounts if it's over 10,000 um as well too and so uh anyway that's just if we can't Source the data straight from Apollo or we need some other filter that's not available in Apollo from a firmographic standpoint we will use whatever other platform we're going to use take those domains and then upload them to Apollo and then you can name it and like all that other stuff and then sometimes we will Source contacts from Google Maps so if a company doesn't have a good LinkedIn presence then we'll use D7 lead finder google map scraper clay Google Maps scraper jwalk doio or whatever it might be so if we're looking for a list of plumbing companies we'll use these softwares and then we'll use our local business lookup table to find the owner's information if they don't have a LinkedIn presence we're not often trying to figure out the chief marketing officer of the company we're just trying to email somebody at the company because oftentimes they're small and whatever it might be and they don't have a LinkedIn profile file and so anyway we already have that workflow built in and it's all it's all just in there and then sometimes we'll use sales Navigator we're currently evaluating crust data to do this but we're confirmed that export list. does this really well and so do scrape and so um sometimes we will get the data from sales Navigator and then we'll still push it through clay and everything so just large overview of our data pipeline is most of the time we go Apollo clay smart lead sometimes we will use a different platform to find the data and then we will go different platform Apollo clay smart lead or then we'll use sales Navigator clay smart lead or then we'll go Google Map scraper clay smart lead and um yeah so anyway then uh just one sop that my team oftentimes needs to be able to do especially if you're scraping Google Maps or something like that is to be able to take company names and then use domains and turn them into domains and so the clearbit uh integration in Clay is really good for this but we also created our own Cent to be able to accomplish this as well too and so this is just a a custom waterfall that you'd be able to save as a recipe so that uh if clear bit doesn't get it we use Cent to be able to to get it so another task and so this isn't so much a clay task but another task that people sometimes will ask us for is they'll say hey I've got this list of business email addresses how can I find job titles of these people well so Apollo actually does this for you for free and so we actually just got this request from a customer today and so this and like this is a little bit of a clay tutorial but this is also my internal team's sop on how we do things and so we just use Apollo to to figure this out you can just import a list into Apollo and then you're good to go just don't import like info or like gmail.com emails uh and you're going to be good to go so if you ever wanted to enrich a list of business emails for that person and their company enrichment Apollo's got it I think contact out has this as well too as a part of their API so that's just another uh alternate route you could also use cagent if you at least have the name input or you could try to use cagent with the the email address and just explain to it that it's going to you know the username is going to be similar to the name and the company and the domain and things like that but normally we'll just use Apollo to just get this data for ourselves and now uh this is our data I call it a data dictionary for just how we find the the different data um so we're going to split this between company data and people data so first off we have traffic enrichment whenever a customer asks us for web traffic we don't have a paid tool we just scrape similar web for it so this table all it's doing is uh it is it's just set up to be able to clean the domain in our input it creates a similar web link We scrap it with zenos we're huge fans of zenos everybody should have an account um it's just such a superpower having it in clay and then it's just limited by Zen's uh concurrency limits but that's just how the cookie crumbles you'll get get the output of the web traffic but you can get anything else from it as well too because it it has all of the data from similar web so whenever we're asked to enrich a uh list with web traffic similar web is the way that we go then if we're ever asked to create a list of companies that have recently raised or we're asked to enrich a list of companies that have uh either raised then we do a couple of different things and so whoops so if we need to Source a list that means that we're going to go to a platform and we're going to generate that list with their filters uh and if we need to enrich a list then we oftentimes will scrape it with uh zenr with crunch base which you get access to right here nope and so uh I was just seeing if there was any other ones and so we normally will Source a list of fundraised companies either by using the native Apollo filters by using crunch base or by using owler and uh that's usually how we get access to all of those um and so yeah that's just generally when we're sourcing this company this is how we're getting it but we will scrape the public pages on crunch base with this integration I'm not going to go over this right now but you can just click it and it's completely done for you you can just you can just use this um you will need a serper dodev uh API key in order for this to work because um it's not as easy as similar web we use Google first to find the page and then we push out and we um we use Google first to find the page and then we scrape it with Zen Rose after that all right and then sometimes uh so clent is also really good at finding this uh this information so sometimes we'll use that and then we also have a zoom info one that you can use as well too that if you want to scrape Zoom info you can get that Zoom info's got phenomenal actually crunch base and zoom info public pages are amazing and they've got a lot of really great uh awesome stuff and so I would definitely check those out uh here I include that you can scrape crunch baser owler with this uh Chrome extension I think everybody should have instant data scraper installed so anyway like I said you can Source from Apollo crunch base or Aller and then we will find companies using Technologies again you could Source this or you can enrich it you Source this with builtwith decom and you can enrich it with builtwith dcom or predict leads we also have our builtwith scraper right here if you want to take advantage of that this is powered by zenr again too and then if you need to Source a list of people who are hiring we will often times use find open jobs inside of clay but then you could also use appify to scrape indeed as well too and then you can enrich I just don't use the Google jobs scraper because I just find that it's just not accurate enough for us to be able to use another thing that customers will often ask us for is finding companies with certain employees so we will use fine contacts at company the integration inside of clay to be able to do this and um we like find contacts that company will often times find you know just like if you need to find a company that has people who are hired internationally find contacts as a company is really good for this if you want to save on Clay credits just use this as a don't save this inside of the same table save it to a new table and I won't use any clay credits and then you can just do whatever you need from there this I unfortunately can't um I think I've made a YouTube video on this but it's too complicated to just give away the shared table because I I honestly can't take questions about the the shared tables but if you want to find contacts with past company experience of current customers I'm pretty sure I have a YouTube video on this and um all you need to do is you just generate a list of your people who are in your ICP generally and then filter for all their past company experience and then write all of those people to another table and do a look up to see if they are have any of the same domains as your customer list and then you can push uh everybody from there again I'm pretty sure I have another video on this you could search it up on my channel I just can't really give the the clay template here um for mobile phone numbers we essentially just use lead magic uh nimbler and people data Labs I don't think that there's any value in using a validation provider what I think is more interesting is to use AI I actually sometimes will turn off off the conditional formulas underneath these waterfalls and I will find I'll use these to find as many phone numbers as I possibly can and then we once we use this to find all the phone numbers that we can then I'll use Ai and say hey did any phone numbers come up multiple times and then I'll use that as my phone validation because clear out all they're doing is they're just seeing if the phone exists there's no like yeah I think this phone number is for this person which I just don't find it to be a good use of money this uh clay table we use this to find if somebody is employed by a company that Apollo thought they were employed by and then we'll also know if they started their job uh in the last six months and if you want to change that you can just change it here don't put six put three and then you'll be able to look it up so if you're looking for people who are newly hired you can use this as a recipe and you're going to get access to it completely um and then we have our own email waterfall I'm not going to share our clay table here just because we we use the HTTP API to get access to kit and then we have lead magic and I I just couldn't change anything what I would say though is we don't use the native clay email waterfall uh for two reasons one once you know how the sausage is made for a lot of these email verification tools you you understand that you don't need to run six email verification tools um and two is if the domain is a catchall domain I'm just not going to send any emails to it and if the domain is a catch-all domain the waterfall might keep finding like it'll say prosio found it but then zero bounce will say it's not valid and then it'll move on and it'll keep charging you credits so we just don't um we just don't do that and so um the way that the sausage is made if you are unaware is so one you can validate emails so if you try to validate eric1 grengine x.com that's going to be an invalid email but if you try to validate Eric growth genex.com that's going to be a valid email address and so what these tools are doing is basically everybody has the same 12 permutations of a name on a domain everybody's email address is like first name at domain or first name last name first name. last name first initial last name last name first like everyone has some form of those as their email addresses and so um essentially what these tools are doing is they're all just guessing and they're seeing which email is valid against that domain and then some of them that are doing catchall email verification are doing some things where if you try to sign in you might not know this but a lot of people when they're doing catchall email verification what they're doing is they're just figuring out okay is this a Google account or is this an Outlook account and if it's a Google or Outlook account they'll go to Google and they'll try to sign in automatically to that email address and if you've ever signed in on Google you know that if you enter an email address that's invalid it'll just say hey this email doesn't exist but if you enter an email address that is valid it'll move you to the next screen asking you for the password and that's essentially how they're doing this catchall email verification stuff another big reason that I Like To Source our data from Apollo uh and uh I mean shout out to zoom info I'd love to do a deal with you guys if you guys are seeing this video um but Zoom info or Apollo do this well this part well and I think everybody should consider putting one of them into their data stack because of their reason so one reason to have Apollo or Zoom info in your stack is because some companies they will have a public facing domain but that is not where they send their emails so for instance intercom is intercom.com but all of their emails are intercom.io and then slack their public domain is slack.com but all their emails are slack hq.com tools like Apollo and zoom info that are feeding off of kind of the community's data if you didn't know that they're taking some of your CRM data but you cons sent to that in the terms and conditions and actually I think that's a good thing from my perspective so uh you know kudos for them to for doing that they will find that and they'll make those distinctions inside of their their platform and I like that they they do that another thing is like if somebody has a name such as and page and at domain.com right and you try to permutate that domain sometimes you'll accidentally get AP at something and that's just their accounts payable email address which turns into some problems if you just trust some of these um email guessing providers so anyway I just wanted to throw that out there other thing that I Like To filter this way I love to find VPS of marketing that mention growth on their LinkedIn profiles or VPS of marketing that mention automation on their LinkedIn profiles or something like that the way you do that is super simple in clay I shared the table there's a really little known formula in clay called stringify that can take an entire output from your clay table and then it can just turn it into uh single well I guess like multi-line text but then you could search all of it and it's super useful and so this uh recipe here takes advantage of that so that you can download somebody's entire LinkedIn profile and then say do they mention this keyword on the profile and that's essentially what it does and then this is our local business contacts finding workflow which I've made a video on that in the past and then everybody should know how to use rights table in clay and so I would say this is this is basically our 101 training internally we have another but this that's why I call it the data pipeline sop because these are most commonly requested things from our customers we have a lot more internal training about clay that I mean I've posted a lot about it and things like that there's not a whole like lot that I'm keeping anybody in the dark here but uh as far as you know how we're doing a lot of our sourcing and how we're doing a lot of our list building this is basically how we're doing it I hope it's useful um like I said I'll post this document use these shared tables and um yeah this is just literally how we do things internally and I just hope that you know um it could help somebody outside so yeah\#\# Date Posted: 2024-02-29

\# Crafting Cold Emails that Get Responses Framework

hey everyone in this video we're going to go over three components of a cold email campaign that is are going to raise your positive response rates there's going to be three components you can run a campaign with each of the components individually or you can uh combine all of them together and you're just going to run a completely better campaign so each individual component I think really helps run successful campaigns and the more that you can use the more successful that it gets so we're going to jump straight into it so the the first step that we have here is defining your perfect customer this is more of you want to work backwards from you know who is your best customer and then that's going to fulfill every other answer uh or every question that we're going to have with the rest of the presentation and so you want to identify your perfect customers mostly so that you avoid your worst customers there are people that are really not a right fit for your business and you're just going to waste a lot of time with them and really identifying a perfect customer is really to identify who are the people you don't want to work with as well and that's just as important as identifying the people that you do want to work with and really focus on your strengths what can you bring to your perfect customer that your competitors can't a question I often ask when we're doing cold email campaigns is what can you say in an email that your competitors can't say and so focus on your strengths identify that perfect customer so that you can avoid your worst customers so now jumping into the the real three components I think there are three really awesome components to a cold email the first one is problem sniffing the second one is extremely relevant social proof and then the El lead magnet that's so good they can't say no as the third one and so we're going to dive into each of these one and two have limitations where I understand you won't be able to use one and two in every campaign out there if you're watching this video and you think to yourself as you go through the video oh I can't use this everyone can use a lead magnet though and so that uh is kind of the catchall for everybody and so uh problem sniffing problem sniffing is when you run a cold email campaign and you target somebody and you have done research with them whether you've done research manually or you've done research automatically to say hey I think you have a problem here I can fix that problem would you like me to do that and so very basic situation here is if you're reaching out to restaurants and people are complaining on the Yelp reviews that the parking lot has a bunch of potholes in it and you fill potholes if you reach out to those restaurants and say hey I found this review here and it says that you need a uh you know the parking lot repaired do you want me to repair the parking lot there's no lead magnet that's going to you know be a better email than that you said hey I know that you have this problem want me to help you fix this problem uh you know you could have social proof in there with the social proof is going to improve your campaign but still like people are still going to positively respond to this campaign and so I know a lot of my customers or people who are watching this work with SAS companies and so if you are a SAS company company and you know you and and so one schema is a company that comes to mind if you see in the reviews on G2 that somebody is saying hey uh you know their CSV import flow is terrible I would go to that company and say Hey you know this customer left you a onear review on G2 and they said your CSV import functionality was not that great one schema could help you fix that and so we found the problem we brought it to them and we said hey I think you might have a problem here let me fix it and so there's lots of different ways that you could do this this video we're not going to get into all the different ways that you can do it because there's all these data and workflows and things like this but examples would be declining web traffic increased team size hiring for roles online reviews and other triggers to let you know that companies are going to have uh they're having problems or they're going to have new problems right so a company raising money obviously is a very good thing that's not as bad as you know reviews uh with one star on them but they're going to have a whole new set of problems now that they've raised this uh money and they have growth trajectory goals and things like that so then the next one is extremely relevant social proof and so you can run a campaign based solely off this and have no other criteria inside of it you just tell the story of a company that is very very very similar to the company that you're reaching out to and you just tell them about what you did what the problem was how you solved it and then you jump into it you're going to get positive responses so saying so basically the difference here is saying we helped another bank increase their deposits by 15% versus we helped another credit union with a wealth management division increase their deposits by 15% with our Facebook ad strategy that can be copied and pasted into your market right so we get super super specific and so the company that's reading this they're used to receiving emails that are you know spray and prey emails so then when you Niche down and you say Credit Union with a wealth management division well that really looks a lot better to them a lot of cold email is I call outrunning the bear where sometimes you just need to be sending better emails than the other emails that are in their their cold email inboxes so you know take that for for what it's worth so I know um extremely relevant social proof isn't possible for you know everyone I because of my work that I did with clay.com I could probably walk up to any outbound Tech SAS company and say look this is what I did for clay.com here's how we got new users uh here's the campaign that I ran would you want to discuss how we could run a campaign like that for you I just tell that story I don't need you know to find problems about them I don't need a crazy lead magnet my lead magnet is the fact that I've been there I've done this and I know exactly what I'm doing and I could repeat those uh same things for you so obviously these have limitations so you know not everyone can find problems \_\_publicly\_\_ sometimes there's things that are very private in a business that you wouldn't be able to dig up publicly and you know if you have a Target address wall Market of50 ,000 companies and you have four case studies and maybe you're covering 10% of the market you can't really use that extremely relevant social proof across everyone right so you need to generalize your social proof to keep social proof in your campaign but you can't make it like a story that you're going to say at every single company so lead magnets are the the best fallback strategy to go behind that and so uh this is a three bullet summary essentially of Alex Hero's offer creation Matrix and his things like that what I often tell people is when you craft your offer crafting a lead magnet is the same exact thing so when you're crafting an offer you want to know Define the dream outcome for a customer you want to list out all their problems and solutions and you want to talk about how you could solve all those problems and solutions and what delivery method you're going to be using for that when you're doing a lead magnet all of the same things still apply except now what you have to think about is how much effort is it going to take me to fulfill on this and that effort has to be done for a free Monetary Exchange so what I mean by that is you're not going to charge for this lead magnet so how much effort can you put in in order to truly provide value that's not going to take up all your time that you're just delivering lead magnets for free all day uh so like I said it's an interface between value and scale so you know you need to have this fine line of um you know offering a great amount of value and having something that doesn't take too much effort to deliver on right you want to be able to scale the dely as much as possible so a good frame to think of your lead magnet through as far as value goes is is there somebody else in the market who is charging for this already or even better do they not even know that this is possible and now we can show them how to do that and we're going to go over how you know some of those lead magnets that we have as well um so they might not even know that this is possible they wish that it was possible every single day and they just don't know how to do it and you come to them and you show them how it's possible and so uh sometimes we'll be working with companies and they say oh my lead magnet is you know we've got this great webinar and we want to share the webinar with them unless it is a truly truly unbelievable webinar that you are charging for access to and you're really actually giving them uh access for free it's really not going to work out like I see all the time when people say oh you know in a cold email where they say oh usually we charge $2,497 for this course but we're going to give it to you for free I don't like putting that in emails because you know oh yeah now I'm on this list of 10,000 other people and I feel so exclusive that I'm going to get this discount it doesn't really work out that way um they're not actually going to believe you that it actually costs that much money because you're just giving it away for free right and so you want to pick a lead magnet that you know that they're paying for in other places and give it to them for free so I always tell my customers uh this is all about how well you know your customers and how well you know the market so I have created lead magnets for my company because I know my customers really well and I know my market really well you have to do this uh the same way because you know your customers better than someone like me would know um so in my opinion the greatest offer and outbound agency can possibly make is not a performance-based offer it's not you know if you hire us we'll get you 15 leads and if we don't get you 15 leads you don't have to pay and all these things I think the greatest offer that an agency could possibly make is hey I've already found these lead for you here you go here's the leads uh if you want to talk about how we can get you more leads let's have a conversation now again remember we have the value versus effort Paradigm here and so this is extremely high value to the company that I'm reaching out to but it's also extremely effortful for me to do this I made the same offer for Tapo and worked with them because of it but it's a lot of effort to do this and I can't do this for every single company because then if I don't get leads and it doesn't work out then I can't keep working with you know and I'm not gonna you know consult with them and things like that so we um so again like I show this to show this is the most valuable thing that we can do but it's also the most effort that we can do and so it's like dang like we gotta draw back the value a little bit and we got to really reduce the effort but what we don't want to do is we don't want to put low effort and low low value we want to be low effort and high value and this is you know I would rate extremely high value so these are offers that we use in our own cold Emil campaigns the first one is 5,000 ICP leads so we basically use AI to generate this email if you have any question about how we get the data just know we used AI to to get all of this data so I could basically walk up to a company and say hey I saw that you um you know help companies with their data uh CSV import flows I figure you sell to directors of engineering heads of product and chief technology officers uh I figured you know because Adam is an strr on your team you're using outbound strategies um as you're looking to put together outbound strategies we help other companies automate their outbound uh you know campaigns we do that with building really great lists first and then automating messaging from there would it be useful if I sent you 5,000 leads in your ident uh ideal customer profile and we could hop on a call and you know see the quality of those leads and what it would look like if we were to run a campaign for you that's one offer that we use and tons of people take us up on that offer so you look at this it's like okay 5,000 leads the tools that sell leads what's their free trial usually it's 100 free leads for a month right I'm offering 5,000 leads in their ICP and I'm going to validate them right so that looks really good another thing that we can do is we can use AI to figure out the case studies of a company so we could go to number two and say a company is working with lead IQ right we can use AI to figure out okay they're working with lead IQ then we can message them and we could say hey considering the fact that you work with lead IQ wouldn't you want to work with companies like apollo.io clay.com infot telligent Zoom info um we could build you a list of lookalike companies to your best case studies so that you'd be able to prospect for them would you want to hop on a 15-minute call and build a look likee audience list together and so we're taking that case study and then we're programmatically finding look likes to that case study so the these two offers are very much in the list building world I think that my agency is extremely good at building lists so we're showing off our value by building these lists the other thing we do for our customers is we build automated workflows we're not only a list Building Company we're a workflow company so we can also show off these workflows for free so what a lot of companies do is they are using clear bit for their sales teams and at best they have clearbit hooked up to a slack Channel where then the sdrs go manually take the website of the company that was on their site then they enrich it and they try to find contacts and then they send manual emails to those contacts uh if that's even getting done at all and my assumption would be if it's a manual task like that the sdrs are getting busy and they're not actually taking advantage of that data and so what we can do is if we detect a company's using clearbit we could walk up to them and we could say hey notice you're using clearbit tell them the story you know at best you know most people are manually reaching out to these leads we set up automated C campaigns for our customers and the clear bit campaign is so easy for us to set up we could set up a campaign for you where we automatically reach out to uh your target prospects as soon as they land on your site would you want to chat about that and so now this is in that realm of they don't even know that this is possible to automate or they don't even know how they could automate it and we're coming to them and we're saying not only are people charging to automate this and we're offering it for free they don't even know how to do it by themselves so it's another great value on top of it then there's the user gems workflow user GS is a company that will take your closed one contacts and monitor them so when the closed one contacts move to a new company you can try to sell to those people or if a contact at a closed One account moves to another company you'd be able to sell into that person as well this is another workflow very easy for us to set up it's almost free for me to run this and so uh I could take you know a list of 10,000 companies and see if anybody from those companies has moved on to another company and then tell uh my customer okay hey you know these people have moved you should really uh you know reach out to them because they have new jobs now again something that they would love to automate I think every company watching this video knows that that's a great play and they just wish that they'd be able to automate it without paying user gems I think starts at $2,000 don't quote me on that but I've heard that it's quite expensive to do that but it's something that I can set up for companies for absolutely free and so I share with you what I do because like I said I know my customers really well and I know the market really well I know that each of these four offers are things that people not only do they charge a little bit of money for they charge a lot of money for On the Open Market 5,000 ICP leads Apollo is charging two and a half cents per contact on that so you know that that's a good chunk of change right there this lookalike company search we do that with ocean. that's you know like a $2,000 monthly payment right there clear bit they don't even know how to automate this if they haven't automated it yet and then user gems um you know $2,000 right there and we can just do all these things for absolutely free so when you're putting together these lead magnets not every lead magnet has to be content and and this takes work for my company to do but the response rates are so worth it to get a conversation started because for all you people who who say you know I'm such a good sales person as long as I get on a call with these people I'll be able to close them no better way to get on a call than with these lead magnets and so this is kind of like a a graph that I drew of effort versus value where if you put no effort into something and it's free elsewhere your prospects really aren't going to care for it if you put a little bit of effort and it's cheap elsewhere and it takes a little bit of time to implement they're not really going to care for it and then it just keeps moving up and so if it's expensive elsewhere or they don't know how to do it um or where you got it from and it takes lots of effort for them to be able to accomplish this is a great lead magnet up here and so now we don't always want to be in this lots of effort difficult you know like high value because then you know you're going to just be fulfilling wead magn all day you need to you know even this out a little bit and so the way we even this out is you play into your economies of scale your insights and the things that you know about the market that they don't and so I think I screwed up this line graph a little bit but see how you can use your insights and your knowledge and your economies at scale to provide value to them so for me because we send a million emails a month sending somebody a list of 5,000 leads for free is nothing to me like I'm already paying for those leads I have so many unlimited contracts that I'm already paying for those leads so I might as well just give it to them but for them you know if they have zoom info or something it's like $1,000 to get that many right and so I'm leaning into my economies of scale to be able to do this when I’m doing the clearbit campaign I’m leaning into my knowledge my knowledge about automations and workflows and how easy it is to set this up and we can just copy and paste it I’m leaning into that where now that’s lots of effort for them to complete but it’s easy for me to complete so it's it's really valuable to them but I move it from lots of effort over to little effort which you know I think I screwed up this graph but whatever um so anyway like I said lean into your insights as a company what what do you have that you can offer them I was speaking with another company that um they you know like they take responsibility for posting jobs and then they get like 200 people to apply for the jobs and then they sift through all the best ones and then they give that to the the company so that they could pick from the best ones that they’ve already sorted through and I told that company why not just send emails and just send the 20 best people for the job that they have open uh and they're like oh we never thought about that I'm like well yeah because like you have all of these insights and all this economies scale you already have collected all the people who are applying for the jobs why not just you know and if they take 20 people from you and they hire somebody and they don’t pay you for it you know whatever like you just move on to the next one right so it's really not not that big of a deal um so all of the so again to summarize I think these three things a lead magnet problem sniffing and really relevant social proof are three components that you can use individually in order to increase your cold email response rates but the the best cold email campaigns combine all three into a super super campaign and so um I hope you have learned a couple of things or I got your mind thinking about a couple of things to add into your campaigns um the last thing I want toit to um leave you with is to also remember to do all of the basics of building a business as well so building a brand is also extremely helpful so we were running cold email campaigns months ago with this subject line outbound ideas and and all of these things and we ran it months ago and just two weeks ago they reached out to me Lov the campaigns then he dug deeper he saw my content and he literally wouldn't leave me alone and so he's like hey your cold email totally worked blah blah blah subject to outbound ideas which this was funny because we sent this months ago I said hey we sent it a couple months ago who are you trying to sell to I said all these things I says yeah let me know if a chat makes sense we going forward and I even told him I was like look I shouldn't even talk to you right now because we can't launch a campaign until January um it is the beginning of November when we first had this conversation no no it was actually October yeah it was the middle of October when we first had this conversation so see because of my brand and all the content that I was posting he was totally drawn to me and so see how he sent me this message I forgot to respond he sent me this message I forgot to respond and then he sent me this message and then I sent my calendly because I I was kind of like look I don’t want to launch a campaign because it's not going to be worth it right now and um because of my brand he kept reaching out and so I see a lot of companies that are trying nothing in any other channel they have no social proof on their website they have no social proof on their their social channels and they're just expecting outbound to work but the first thing that these companies are doing when they receive an email from you is they’re looking up your website to see you know what they can find about you and how credible the company is so um I also would really really suggest as like a you know a part kind of four of this the three components is to do all the other things to show how great of a company and the great work that you do with other companies is um and so yeah this is not an exhaustive list of things that are going to make you successful but I think people make videos about how to make a successful cold email camp campaign and these things often get omitted and so I wanted to make a video dedicated to them\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Using GPT \- 4 to Create Custom Outbound Proposals for Companies

hey everyone in this video we're gonna go over writing some pretty dang personalized emails using gpt4 now I haven't checked if you could do this with GPT 3.5 but let's get into it I was using 4.0 and I wanted to try some crazy things so basically what I attempted to do was to be able to automate writing an email where I would be able to give pers potential marketing advice to companies just based off of their LinkedIn company description and after only testing things for about 30 minutes the results are pretty dang good and so I'm going to talk about the prompt at the beginning of this video and then I'm gonna go one by one into we will go through all 15 of these results just to check out some of these results and talk about how I would fix them in the prompts because I spent about 40 minutes on this but uh I'll definitely be spending more time in the future so first let's jump into the prompt that we used and so I was conversing with chat CPT I was using bottle uh number four and I basically just set it up and said hey you're an assistant helping me come up with outbound marketing campaigns for companies nice and easy uh then the user input was using the input create three bullet points of creative outbound marketing ideas for a company this is the input and then I just put in uh Apollo's uh criteria in here and then I said be specific and give you unique advice keep each bullet point around 15 words and use strategies that use outbound marketing we could of course improve this so then I was the assistant and I gave it some ideas Target companies that just added sales people to the team and reach out to the VP of sales uh Target companies that mentioned Zoom info are cognizant or other competitors in their job descriptions Target companies that are industries that typically require the need for outbound data super easy to be honest I kind of ran out of ideas for the third one um maybe I should have had chat GPT write it but then we got this done and then I went right into it with message number four automatically I would improve this by giving it more examples of ways that we could help companies but for this video it definitely served the purpose so then as the user we said the same exact thing but I used the LinkedIn company description as the input so again analyze who their target audience would be by job title and think of creative ways to Market to them be specific and give unique advice all those different things so that's how we set up the prompts now join me for the rest of the video where we go over each of the pieces of content so this one would be for Salesforce and the idea is Chachi petite came up with for their outbound marketing campaigns is to Target VPS of marketing in B2B firms send them well-designed Direct Mail series highlighting CRM success stories not a phenomenal phenomenally creative idea but if you were sending this cold to somebody it would make them feel like you actually did some research possibly identify sales managers collaborate with highly regarded podcast hosts for sponsored episodes showcasing CRM benefits approach customer support managers run targeted LinkedIn ads sharing Innovation through enhanced customer experiences using CRM so not all of these would be possible through just regular like cold email outbound I would have to change the prompting for that but not bad all right so for Red Bull Target event planners offer co-branded Red Bull event kits to Boost energy during conferences and corporate events approach sport that's not bad that's actually you know if you were to get that cold that's a perfect idea for Red Bull approach Sports coaches connect to provide Red Bull for team performance enhancement and sponsorship opportunities great the better part about here is the targeting that was pretty interesting reach out to Club bar owners promote Red Bull drink recipes and customize drink promotions again not bad I actually like the Red Bull one better than the Salesforce one all right so this is for gong.io Target cross showcase how gong improves cross team collaboration and decision making with data-driven insights engage sales managers share success stories of sales coaching and performance improvements using gong's platform that's really interesting to that it you know brought that out knowing that the performance improvements is the biggest reason why people buy gong reach out to sales Ops leaders highlight gone's ability to streamline Revenue process through actual customer insights that's I would I would give that's awesome okay great outreach.io launch a LinkedIn campaign targeting sales directors with personalized tips or case studies that one's okay not great uh email campaign targeting uh email campaign targeting VP of sales mentioning competitive success stories and unleash conference they must have been put their conference in there partner with sales podcast or webinar sponsoring exclusive tips for sales managers and team leads not bad not my favorite Outreach was a little generic but that one's totally fine test box Target procurement managers send interactive product demos for faster decision making engage marketing directors showcase proven customer-led buying results boosting ad campaigns uh approach product managers offer product testing comparisons to impress investors and clients approach product this one was okay um not too thrilled with the results on this one for example Target procurement managers send interactive product demos for faster decision making I would improve the prompt to get a better understand to say it's a try to help it understand what the company does because the company creates product demos as a service kind of it's not like they are sending product demos for people to then use test box so something to be done around that all right so seamless AI use AI generated sales pitch emails targeting sales managers or directors highlighting seamless ai's potential okay host a webinar for sales executive focusing on ai's impact on lead generation and market share growth that would definitely work I see a lot of good results on that develop case studies focused ads for sales VPS showcasing seamless AI success stories and revenue growth that's actually the ads that they legitimately run right now Brandon is running ads literally like that I see them all the time zoom.com engage corporate HR and talent acquisition teams with personalized virtual event invites to Showcase zoom's recruitment Solutions possibly I didn't even know they had recruitment Solutions reach out to managers overseeing remote teams promoting Zoom at the as the ultimate communication and collaboration tool target event planners and coordinators showcasing zoom's reliability for virtual events still not bad again if this was coming through cold you would think somebody wrote it I think that that passes that bar maybe not that they aren't great ideas but we can keep going kajabi Target life coaches and motivational speakers offering ebooks webinars or online courses again this probably goes back to the test box one we need a little bit of a prompting for it to understand better that this is the company and they do a specific thing because this is already you know they don't want to offer ebooks and webinars and online courses about kajabi they want to teach life coaches and motivational speakers how they could be offering ebooks and webinars and online courses reach Educators shifting to online courses offering kajabi's platform for seamless transition yep that would be a good idea identify Fitness and Welfare Wellness professionals marketing tools for creating workout or diet plans online see that's a great idea there we go again pretty good ideas and if you use those in a cold emails somebody probably would have thought you actually wrote them ocean.io offer webinars specifically for data analysts on improving prospecting with AI powered look like searches okay so this is interesting because they don't sell to data analysts they sell to sales people so we got it a little wrong here and we'd have to fix the prompt Target marketing managers using personalized email campaigns highlighting successful niche market case studies that's yep that would work engage sales directors via LinkedIn by sharing industry specific tips and content on hypertargeted outbound strategies yep um another way that I would probably fix this is we only gave it one piece of content for what I would say a successful message looks like I think we could also fix say ocean a little bit of kajabi's test box outreaches we could fix these by offering just more examples in the prompt one password offer webinars to it managers promoting seamless integration with existing IAM Solutions okay email marketing campaign targeting HR professionals on improving employee onboarding experiences yep engage with ctOS on LinkedIn showcasing success stories in securing business data this one was okay again I'd probably give it some better examples and that would fix that um help desk offer personalized demos to it managers by hosting webinars showcasing help desk's Solutions okay reach CTO is using LinkedIn emails with compelling stats about helpdesk's long-standing industry impact interesting Target customer support managers with cold email campaigns highlighting CRM customization options and success stories go again if you sent this off to help desk they might say that these ideas are okay but these ideas were definitely made for them one signal targeting marketing managers with personalized emails campaigns touting ease of use and omni-channel capabilities that's true conduct LinkedIn Outreach product managers highlighting scalability and API Integrations offered by one signal great host an informative webinar for e-commerce site honors on how to boost engagement and conversions with one signal analytics what I think is really interesting about this is it got these three awesome outputs of titles right marketing managers product managers and e-commerce site owners which is who they target which is pretty interesting taplio offer free LinkedIn content templates to HR managers for engaging potential recruits that one's okay that's not really what their platform is made for appeal to B2B sales representatives tailored messaging campaigns to boost lead generation that's true engage freelance social media managers with success stories to Showcase growth through our services see how it it um we don't want to say our services it would have been your services again we could probably fix this with prompting but it would probably be better with more examples gymshark Target professional trainers and fitness coaches offering exclusive gymshark discounts to recommended it to clients yep that's probably exactly what they do already that's awesome reach out to influencers in the health and fitness Niche providing them with personalized gymshark products to promote they 100 do that connect with Wellness oriented HR professionals proposing gymshark's workout gear for company Health initiatives that's a really good idea too uh bricks send personalized emails to CFOs and finance managers promoting tailored financial decision making resources awesome that's really good hosts exclusive webinars for HR professionals emphasizing employee Financial Empowerment benefits awesome Target startups remote company CEOs with Direct Mail including infographics on better financial decisions for distributed teams so again lots of things that we could fix here but a lot of things that were really really awesome uh you know for the most part these would pass the test now obviously these are ideas that these companies are probably already implementing these are all top tier companies with great teams but if you're reaching out to smaller companies who they might be thinking when they read these emails they might be thinking okay they're actually looked at my business which is one of the main hurdles that we want to cross and they're actually giving us ideas straight from the get-go which you know a lot of these are very much in line with what companies would want to be doing and maybe they don't have a person to implement it yet I'm gonna probably make another list of some people that I would want their opinion on if they were to get a cold email just with this straight up or I might even make a small list and just send them this cold email and see how they react um and see how well this play would really work because I think this is pretty interesting um and we got to tease it out a little bit more so keep following along and seeing how we use these I'll be announcing the results of this on places like LinkedIn and Twitter but very excited for what gpt4 is bringing uh for us and actually before anyone goes I'm gonna try to rerun the same thing in 3.5 and see if there's a huge difference okay so to be honest pretty great results here as well this uh these this text was generated with gpt4 this checks test was generated with three point GPT 3.5 still pretty good I mean see how a lot of it is still online and I'm not going to go through all these again and maybe I'll open them up so if you want to pause the video you can kind of read some of these um they're not bad and it's much cheaper to run it on 3.5 than it is on four so wow leverage help desk latest industry news section since that's that's really interesting okay yeah so um read through some of these on your own you know actually 3.5 might be able to ship this as well but uh thanks for watching everyone\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Email Deliverability Overview End of 2023

all right in this video we are going to talk about your email infrastructure this is probably the most tedious task that you need to set up in order to send your email campaigns and uh sometimes it gets really confusing but it's actually much more straightforward than you might think um it's just you need to know what you're looking at what numbers and like how to troubleshoot some things and so when we run our email infrastructure for clients what we do is a multi-domain multi- inbox box approach and so this is just one of the ways that you can uh start your email campaigns and so uh I'm going to talk about why we do this and some Alternatives the reason why we use a multi-domain multi- inbox approach is because no matter how great your campaign is people are going to mark you as spam and when you get marked as spam the reputation of your domain and the reputation of your inbox goes down if you are using the same domain and the same inboxes uh to run cold email campaigns as you're using for your uh customer communication your investor communication your marketing email communication your internal communication well maybe not internally but you know that might be said um if you if the reputation of those domains and those inboxes go down because you're using them for cold email your customers are going to start having emails go to spam and you know it's going to turn into issues you you're not going to be able to communicate them and at worst if you're running ads to add people to your marketing email list and those emails are going to spam you're like wasting money on building this list and so that's like the the biggest reason this is not the only way to send emails I want to be very clear about this um you can also send emails from subdomains we have one customer that's doing this right now and we get them like 78% open rates we get great inbox rates for them and then you could also send from private smtps uh like send Grid or actually for C email I probably would only send it from s grid to be completely honest this approach has is the approach that we have found is one the best Roi two is also the most scalable and modular and three is just the most reliable and so you could do all the rest of these things but this is the most important stuff one more disclaimer nothing is as important as getting your list and your offer correct as long as you do those things you will be you could send from your main domain if if you got your offer dialed in and nobody's marking you a Spam and you're sending to the correct list you could just keep going and you could send from your main domain nothing's going to happen but most of us like we we can't do that like and also there's people who are going to Mark us to spam it no matter what I tell this story I was I was at a conference and I was going to all the vendors and I was talking to them about their email deliverability setups and this that and the other thing and I talked with one guy and I said you know Eric I send from our main domain and we have 10 sales reps who each send 200 emails from each of their inboxes we send from our main domain and we get a 65% open rate do you think you we have the problem and I told them no you actually probably don't have the problem everything points to the fact that that you're actually doing fine and so I want you to to see all of this and actually I checked their domain and they didn't even have a DeMark set up which we're going to talk about in this DNS authentication section but the the reason I mention all of this is because all of these things are best practices if if you're already getting results the reason I would still recommend to do this is because one day there could be a problem and you don't want to wait three weeks to warm-up domains you want to just have them on constant rinse and repeat that you'd be able to just swap them in um we have internally 60 domains and 120 inboxes so if I ever wanted to try any kind of campaign we're ready to go and we can launch them immediately and so yes you can send from your main domain if you like but you are running that risk and this multi-domain multi- inbox approach is the one that we found works the best and so when we're doing like multi-domain multi- inbox what we're doing is we're essentially buying multiple domains that look like your domain and so um it's like go growth engine x.com get growth engine x.com that kind of stuff right um and we're we're buying like 10 of these um and we'll talk about the math behind this pretty soon uh and so always stick to buying.com domains and try to include your brand in the domain as well what I will say is that every like not everybody 10% of our customers come to us and they're concerned about what the domain looks like to the recipient and while I think that matters remember that with your DNS authentication and your setup and everything you can forward get growth engine x.com to growthin x.com so if anybody looks up the domain it'll go straight to your website so all of your marketing is still going to be lined up we have got gotten we get tons of responses actually um my burner domain setup is like a variation of like simple automation.com um we don't own that I like have many variations of that domain and that's our burner domain set up one of my burner domains is uh go simple automation HQ access.com and we get responses to that one it it doesn't have a brand it points to growth engine X it kind of doesn't make sense and like it totally works so don't get too hung up on the um the domain that you buy make them look good like we we still want them to look good I'm not saying to buy crappy domains and it's going to work like still buy good-looking domains but don't get too hung up on them being perfect always stick to buying.com domains umco is okay this whole email infrastructure you need to think about what does a spammer do and how can I do the opposite of it and so spammers will buy like facebook. XYZ and that just like looks it it's just a problem like don't don't do that um stick with Google and output outlook for your inboxes the reason why we use Google and Outlook is um it looks totally normal to send 50 emails a day from a Google account like it's not unheard of for people to legitimately do that maybe it's a little bit heavy to be doing that every single day but it's not unheard of for people to do that and so what we do is we just hide amongst the crowd of everybody else who's sending that kind of volume and we you know that makes up like cold email is like you know only a small percentage of all the real email that goes on and so as Gmail cracks down on spam you have to remember that they can only crack down on spam to the point that it doesn't affect other users and so if a user were to sign up and then start sending messages to people that have never received an email from them before but they know who they are and they're just you know sending email that's not in their contacts like they always have to allow for that to happen they can never shut that down you like a student is going to be reaching out to a company about a job you know opening like that's always going to happen and so they they will never be able to crack down on spam or cold email 100% because it'll start affecting users too much so that's why we stick with these anytime I've tried to get away from Google and Outlook it's always burned me in the face and it like goes completely wrong so I don't step away from Google and Outlook I I just stick with these inboxes if I had a preference I don't know maybe I like Google this is also October 2023 things change in the email game all the time um who knows and so that's like a quick top level over that DNS authentication you need to make sure you get your SPF whoops SPF dkim dmark MX records forwarding and custom tracking setup so SPF dkm you the when you set up your inboxes they the platforms will tell you how to set these up you you really shouldn't have to think about these too much this is just a check mark that you need to think of DeMark is one that people miss all the time I see this all the time that people don't have a DeMark record on their domain because it's not 100% necessary but in today's emailing environment it's it's really necessary and so um you need to set up the Demar record um you can Google how to do this it's so easy to do this I'm not even going to include a tutorial right now because it's that easy to do MX record gets set up when you're setting up inboxes usually forwarding um just look up how do you do like a 301 redirect on your DNS Hoster uh I use GoDaddy and so you literally could just forward gothen x.com to growthin x.com so if anybody types it in um you get that and then the tool that you use to send email which we're going to go over next is a um they're going to have a custom tracking domain set up you just want to follow their tutorials to to set that up so now we'll go we'll talk about mass email sequencing tools so the Old Guard of mass email sequencing tools is like Outreach sales Loft maybe par do I don't know companies like that right oh uh LM list and so what these platforms do is they log into your Gmail account and they're they're sending emails on your behalf from your Gmail inbox the what these companies do though is they charge oh Apollo does this too um these uh these companies all charge based on how many users you have and so um the new companies and I I don't know like the new companies that we recommend is smart lead . a and instantly. um and I think I I have suggestions for people whenever you're using these so instantly AI is uh more userfriendly and it's easier for a person to just get started and just get going they have a leads database it's really great just you can get started on there smart lead AI is really great if you like really need to do custom Integrations you want to work with their API um and and that kind of stuff and so what these companies did that's so different is these companies charge per seat these companies just charge by how many leads you have in like on your on your platform so when you're doing this multi- domain multi- inbox approach if you have 20 inboxes for one salesperson which I don't totally recommend if you have 20 inboxes for one salesperson on Outreach that's going to be like two grand a month that you have to pay um smartly and instantly they don't charge you per inbox so it's just a flat rate of 100 uh dollars a month or whatever their pricing is I don't know the whatever it is and so that's why we suggest using these tools is because they don't charge for each user so like Apollo is catching on to this lemlist is catching on to this um these tools probably won't do anything about this and so uh we always use these tools whenever you're thinking about sending these mass cold emails you always want it to come from the Gmail inbox if you're using so if you attach a Google account to one of these tools and you either owe off into the account or you like set up an SMTP integration with your inbox the tool is okay if you're looking at a tool like HubSpot MailChimp or Constant Contact these tools are not not set up for sending cold emails the the technology is similar but it's not the same HubSpot is set up for sending marketing emails people who have opted into your list and they say hey I want to be on this list email me I'm here and I'll unsubscribe if ever get you know I I want to be off this list totally different than a person that um you're cold emailing and so here the technology is different there's this thing called an SMTP which is like the technology that all of these uh companies are sending email by Gmail's SMTP it they control the IP addresses you know they know what's going on they can track your reputation all those things HubSpot is going to give you an SMTP from send grid and um when you send those emails out the smtps reputation if you're using it to send cold email is going to go down and it's just not it's not going to be a successful campaign from you so HubSpot mail Chim and Constant Contact well HubSpot marketing they're all sending from like a private SMTP server or a shared SMTP server um and they're either going to kick you off the platform for doing that because it's against their terms of service and they don't want you doing that um or they're just going to give you like a 7% open rate it's going to be really really really terrible and so um use these for marketing emails do not use those for cold email so the way that you know that the email sequencing tool that you're using is good besides all of the other Integrations is if you ow off into the account and you're sending from your actual Google inbox or your burner Google inboxes that's the tool you need to be using all of the other features you could figure out what your preference is so smart lead and instantly AI are the tools that we talk about here email warmup okay what is email warm-up email warm-up is a process where you build the reputation of your domain and your inbox again remember you whatever spammers do we want to do the opposite of what spammers do what spammers do is they buy a domain they get an inbox and they start ramming cold emails we don't want to do that what a warm-up network does is you join a network of say 100,000 other inboxes that are in the the warm-up Network and you consent to the warm-up Network and you say Hey you know automatically send emails from my inbox to people in the warm-up Network those people have promised not to Mark me a Spam and their the technology is also going to like if my email does go to spam it'll get saved and stuff like that and so um I'm going to send them email they're going to send me emails we're going to build our reputation together and so now Google can't track these warm-up networks because again they can only affect users to the point that it doesn't affect regular users and so it's totally normal for you to get a new domain get an inbox and send five emails a day and then the next day you send 10 and then the next day you send 15 that's totally totally normal and so that's what these email warm-up to tools are doing smartly and instantly do do it for you and so um you know instantly really broke the game with like their their offer when they first came out and so the email warmup um then builds the reputation so you warm up your emails um for three weeks we're going to go over the numbers right after this you warm up your emails for three weeks you start running a campaign you send those those inboxes on your list as far as and then Google looks your reputation and they say oh as far as we're concerned they've sent emails for three weeks and they've been sending 50 emails a day for a week they've never been flagged to spam they look good and that's how you're able to get the inbox delivery that you want and so that's what email warm-up is and and that kind of thing so let's talk about the numbers right and so um how long should you warm inboxes uh 3 to four weeks here's the thing with warming inboxes if you can wait 3 to four weeks the inbox placement rate and the longevity of the inbox is going to be really really optimal it's really great if you can wait three to four weeks it it's it inboxes really well they don't burn as quickly three to four weeks is kind of that sweet spot that we found if you can warm longer like it's October right now if you want to send emails during Thanksgiving in December you should set up inboxes now and then warm them for two and a half months it like they would be really really great by the time you get started but for most people three to four weeks that's all they can kind of wait totally cool here's the thing with email warm-up that's kind of a an aside if you are a Founder who you need leads now you can still follow all of these processes um the email structure the the multi-domain multi- inbox approach and if you need to get started now you don't actually have to wait for the three to four weeks of warm-up you can wait for two weeks and it's going to work pretty well or if you can do the extra work you can start the campaign immediately just know that the inboxes are going to burn in like a week or two and you're going to have to set up more so if you need to get started right away you could set up more inboxes launch the campaign and instead of sending 50 emails a day which we're going to go into um you send like 10 or 15 emails a day you could still get started so I want you to know about that that caveat but we warm for three to four weeks um we do five five email emails per day as a warm-up and we add five each day so this is basically like day one five emails are going to get sent day two 10 emails are going to get sent day three 15 emails are going to get sent and we do a 50 email cap so it keeps adding per day five more emails until we get a 50 email cap per day and then we're looking for a 32% response rate on warmup emails so this actually has there's no science to this um at all it's I just put 32% just cause um yeah don't put 100% because again think about how that looks to Google you send emails and then for three weeks 100% of the people started were responding and then you start a cold email campaign and then nobody responds like that looks really weird so always do like a 20 to a 40% response rate on the warm-up emails and so when you launch your campaign so it'll be like during during the campaign we send 50 emails per day per inbox so yeah I mean that's exactly what it means so we send 50 emails per day per inbox it's 2023 right now in October probably in 2024 we're going to switch this to like 30 or something but for now we're going to keep it the same um we Chang the email warmup to 10 emails per day with a 100% response rate um and then the other thing and so now the the only other math that you would need to know about this is like all right if you want to send 500 emails per day how does that math work out so like I said we send 50 emails per day we do two inboxes per domain so now I don't really have the science on like you know setting up two inboxes is better than three inboxes I I really don't have that but what we have found is if we set up like five um that domain does get burned faster so like two to three is kind of our range so if you want to send 500 emails per day um 500 emails per day turns into uh let's see you need well so it's just 500 divided by 50 right so then it's 10 so it turns into 50 emails per inbox I need 10 inboxes to get to 500 which means I need five domains so then if you the other thing that I would say is always set up back up domains they're cheap enough that yeah so you're buying five domains here and you're getting two inboxes on each of those domains buy another three and put two inboxes on them because you always want to be able to hot swap hot swap them in and out and another module we'll be talking about how to set up inboxes one by one um oh I made a note for myself we'll talk about how to set up inboxes oneon-one and then also how to do it with automation um that'll be a separate module on how to do that for Outlook and how to do that for Google um and here are some just questions that come up pretty often and so um one does this affect my SEO so this is a big question uh people get all the they ask me this not all the time it's like H like a fifth of the time people are asking this question does this affect my SEO absolutely absolutely not so the the hypothesis here is okay so we're sending emails from gogrow engine x.com um Google isn't an idiot would if we start getting spam complaints on this domain would growth engine x.com SEO be affected um so I've never seen any evidence of this before and it's never happened knock on wood to to any of our clients right the but so that hypothesis sounds good because you're like forwarding them and there's a connection and go growth engine X goes to growth engine X and and all those things the hypothesis sounds good but I'll give you another hypothesis um if that were true what I could just do is set up domains that look like my competitors and then try to sell Viagra over email and then just completely torch those domains and then ruin their SEO so I don't think that's something that's ever going to happen because then that would be such a hack to like ruin somebody else's SEO is because anybody can buy a domain that's similar to your brand name and forward it to you they don't need permission they don't need anything to be able to do that so I I don't think that's ever really going to happen um does the domain that I buy matter how it looks we talked about in the beginning yes like make it as close to your brand name as you possibly can we try to do that when we do it on behalf of our clients um but if if your domain like one person their domain was um thre letters.com like it was a three-letter word and then. um we can't just buy like try the three-letter words and then Doom like you it would be too expensive and so um for them we we added like one prefix like I think we added like automation to the the prefix and then we permutated those so that's just try to make it look as great as you can I went over this can we just send from our main domain you you have all of these risks if you do that if you need to send from your main domain at least use a subdomain those domains do have a separate reputation to the main domain so um try to do that um okay and here's a question we get all the time um aren't spammers the only one that have to think about this so basically the question is if we're sending out relevant emails to the right list and we're doing a good job and we're checking all of the boxes uh shouldn't we not have to do this like isn't this only something that hackers have to do and so what I say to that is um no matter what and how good your email is people are going to Market a Spam one time I ran a campaign um was a campaign meant for a Sunday and it was a Sunday during a huge conference in San Francisco um I think it was the Salesforce conference what is the dreamforce so it was a Sunday when dreamforce was approaching and what we did was we automatically pulled in the weather in San Francisco so that like uh we would basically say like hey you know I just wanted to send an email to you because I saw your company was doing XYZ I'm the founder of this company um so you know I'm just going through my Sunday chores just like I thought you would be we the only reason I broke my rule of introducing myself is because I wanted to be obvious that it was a Founder to founder email and then we said something about like hey you know like uh as dream force is about to take over the city are you thinking about this then we got into our pitch PS I saw that it was 75 degrees in San Francisco today you know I hope you make the most of it before dreamforce comes around somebody still emailed us back and said stop spamming me I marked you a spam and I was like okay we sent it to like 200 people and like one person said that I was like okay it was like all the timing and everything still came together and I was like alright whatever totally cool um so people are going to Mark you a Spam no matter how great your campaign is and that's just that's just the way that it is I think another thing that I I do want to like I see this all the time is if you're not confident about the numbers right um as long like when I say the numbers I mean like how many emails should you send per day um how many how many emails should you send per day how long should you warm up all this stuff if you're not sure about that stuff as long as your SPF dkm dmark and all this other stuff is set up freaking just start the campaign um I see so many people getting so hung up by the numbers and they went their whole lives doing cold email and not knowing about email deliverability and then they like learn about it for a week and it just paralyzes them don't let it paralyze you always be trying to do the best practice but if it's stopping you from launching a campaign just Just Launch don't don't get so hung up um one time we accidentally you know this is when I first started so if you're thinking about working with us you know this doesn't happen anymore but um this was when I was still setting up inboxes for my agency and there was a customer that I completely forgot to set up inboxes for and we needed to launch their campaign in two days another part was because it was kind of like a nonprofit that we were just doing doing um like uh you know like at cost it was a really cheap campaign and so I forgot to set up their inboxes the first day we sent emails um so I set up their inboxes and the next day we launched the campaign the first day I sent out emails I sent like 15 emails per inbox and we had like an 80% open rate and then I was just like all right let's just try and then I ramped it to 50 emails per day and we kept that 80% open rate and so um like I said you don't have to do any of this as long as the people on the other side of your campaign are responding positively to your campaign this is all kind of moot points so the the thing that I would just keep in mind is nothing is as important as your offer nothing is as important as your list everything else is kind of secondary but these are one of the things that's really really important and if you're getting like low open rates it's one of the first things that you should be checking but my main point here is don't let these numbers paralyze you just get started with the campaign and don't um hold yourself back from getting started um and so yeah this is the email setup that we use you can find more information um at smart lead and instantly. they have great documentation on this and um yeah a lot of what we do is exactly what they suggest to do we we did not reinvent the wheel here so get after it let's get going uh the next modules will show how to set up the the Outlook in the Google uh inboxes and things like that\#\# Date Posted: 2024-10-01

\# Exploring Mechanisms vs Outcomes in Cold Email

all right hey everyone got a little bit of a different video coming for you today I have not been posting about this a lot but currently it is October 1st and I am finishing up the last week of a road trip and so I wanted to put out a video on something that I'm thinking about but because I'm on my road trip I haven't had much time to prepare anything so I'm just going to talk into my camera and my airpods and uh this is one of those videos that I don't really have a whole lot of proof uh yet for this but it's something that I'm thinking about and I want to document it and I want to start a conversation with other people who might be thinking about the same thing so when we're running outbound campaigns uh I am thinking more right now about why an outbound campaign doesn't work versus why some other outbound campaigns work and what we can do to fix outbound campaign uh because something in the cold email community that you might hear is you know sometimes you have an offer that isn't good for cold email and I keep trying to question that belief as much as I can because how are you getting customers then you know you are communicating what you do to other people and they're interested in it and that's what cold email is and so I would say probably the biggest blocker to cold email being effective might be if your offers is very timing dependent and so that's a very obvious one that if they only evaluate these things once a year it's not like they're going to just be able to respond to a cold email at any time and so anyway um what I'm specifically thinking about currently with our current outbound campaigns is using the mechanism of your offer in the outbound campaign versus using the outcome in your outbound campaign and I'm going to break that down and so I know that you'll hear people say all the time don't sell the plane ticket sell the vacation and so if you haven't heard that before it is a very tried and true I'm not even sure if it's a theory of marketting at this point it might even be tried and true so much that it's a law of marketing that you should be selling people outcomes instead of uh selling them how you get it done um and so you this would go to say that you should be selling people the fact that we can increase your Revenue by 5% you know you should be selling that versus the way that you help people do that and I'm challenging this a little bit and maybe as I go through this video we can figure out where I'm challenging it from but I'm testing two things that are working right now that I wanted to share with people and I'm going to talk through exactly how and so when I'm talking about leaning more into the mechanism or leaning more into the outcome what I'm basically talking about is in your cold email getting very very specific about your process and why they should use the process or completely leaving your process out of the email and only talking about outcomes and so I'm just going to give two stories that kind of go with this is so uh we were working with a virtual assistant Staffing Outreach company and um one of the things that they would do is we they'd say you know we go through this entire process to pick people so you don't have to go through that process boom boom we can help you save money all these things and so one thing that I was thinking about was why don't we lean into this mechanism more and why don't we give them the idea of how we get it done so they can trust us in the process right because every virtual assistant company is trying to say that they hire the best people but they can't all prove it so we dug into the process they basically they turn away 80% of the people who even apply to work for them they have them fill out four different tests to make sure that they do everything they make sure that they can show up on time to three different calls and then they use that person in the company for two weeks before they let a customer use that person and it was like oh my God great you have a great mechanism you're not just hiring random people vetting them a little bit you have a great way to actually do this so when we put it in the outbound campaign the the response rates started going up and we did a lot of this by putting it below the signature and so we would say like this is how we you know can help businesses we use AI to basically say like we think offshore Talent can help you with these tasks and I think it can help your business below our signature here's our process if you'd want to talk you know let's talk about how we can get a person place for you and then below the signature we would say boom boom boom boom boom and so then um I was even coaching somebody and I actually have to reach out to them as well too about how this went but they had an offer and they were trying they only had 4,000 people that they could reach out to and they were trying to increase their response rates and I I'll give an update in the description but this is another example uh and I'm just not sure if it worked yet but it follows the same guideline where he only had 4,000 people to reach out to but he had a great offer for them and I was saying look you should share your case studies with them 100% but then below the signature you should outline exactly how you do each and every thing uh in there and so uh like and make it like a six-step process to show like how detailed you are before you you do this offer and I got to reach out to him to see if it increased his response rates but he there but in both these instances we're leaning very very hard into the mechanism and how we can help people and I think this works when people they know what the outcome is they just don't trust you right and so I know like you always want to be selling the vacation not the plane ticket but sometimes people already know what the vacation is like and they just need to make sure that there's a good plane ticket for them to get there so that's one thing that we're thinking about right now and like I said if you H if they I think I think this applies very well if they know what the outcome is like and they just need to trust the person to be able to get there right and then the other thing that we're thinking about is completely on the opposite end of the spectrum and it's like well what if you were to just completely take out any even thought of the mechanism and only talk about outcomes right and so we were working with a company that um they do Facebook ads uh optimization and they do a lot of Facebook ads optimization and um we were sending emails and we were talking about the Facebook ad optimization and it was working okay we were getting bites but it it was just working okay it wasn't anything crazy and so then we we we leaned into the mechanism and that didn't really work they didn't really care about the process that we went through if anything that actually hurt our results a little bit and I'll share that Insight too is we would lean into the mechanism and then when we did it at scale not everybody agreed with the methodology and there was some things in our mechanism that had to have been explained and people just didn't agree and actually we we started getting some people saying that they they didn't agree with the the methodology uh to be used and so then what we did was we just said okay you know what let's just not even talk about the mechanism here and let's just go crazy just talking about the outcome and don't even tell people how how it um happens and we didn't mention Facebook ads we didn't mention anything we just used Ai and we said we know you're going after these kinds of people and I think your average order value is around this number I'll talk about average order value again on another campaign um we think your average order value is around this number with companies like yours and then we would do an if then statement depending on how big the company is um and how big their average order value was we'd put in different case studies and different sentences about the case study and we'd put three case studies in so we just say hey we've helped companies accomplish this we' help companies accomplish this we've help companies accomplish this I think we could help you would you want to trat even if all we talk about is how we accomplish that success for them right and so again no like not talking about the mechanism at all we're just talking about the outcome and in that case it would increase the response rates um as well too and I'm going to finish up with another story um I posted a YouTu video about this and it was crazy so we send sometimes insane outbound emails in my opinion insane outbound emails and so one email we sent was we basically would say let me just get the wording down actually okay I just looked up we would we were selling a bookkeeping SL tax advice um service and so what we were doing was we would look up who they're trying to Target what kind of business they're in and then we would like say something different if they had products that they had to keep track of an inventory that they could keep track of we'd say something different if it was SAS we'd say something different if they were a consultant company we would say something different uh you know in all these different ways and then it was like it got crazy because it was like if it was stas then we were talking about you know the international hires and keeping track of all those people and then all the software spends that they have and then we use built with to figure out what tools they're using and it's like are you guys keeping track of your usage over here and then if it was like a management company we'd pull case studies off the website and we'd say do you know how much you know how many hours are going into this company versus going into this company and we just made it pretty insane and so it was bookkeeping and tax service so it's really more like a CFO type offer I guess and so we were very much leaning into the mechanism and how you know we found data about these companies we found hard data to say with this data we can help you and this is the mechanism in which we would help you but then honestly when we simplified the campaign and then we just looked to see if there was any person at the company that was a finance or accounting role and if there wasn't we would just say hey I took a quick look on LinkedIn I didn't see anybody with Finance or accounting role on your team I know you might be using an outside contractor how do you know that your current outside service or somebody on your team is taking advantage of every legal loophole that the IRS would allow you to take to reduce your tax liability and so then we just did that and we simplified the campaign nothing about the mechanism and all we did was just switch that and we just talked about the outcome we're just like how how do you know that you're taking advantage of all these legal uh loopholes we we're going to help you and I mean I we weren't talking directly about the outcome but I hope you can see that inherently we're saying our outcome is that we're going to help you find all these legal loopholes response rates went up like crazy and so this is what I'm thinking about now is I think a lot of times when we're all writing emails and I see it because I see people posting on LinkedIn I see other people are doing it too I see that we're we're all basically giving a little bit about the mechanism giving a little bit about the offer and trying those things what we're going to start doing with our customers is we're going to start leaning really really hard into the mechanism and how it all works and getting really really really granular and saying like you know I am confident in our process because these are all the things that we take care of for you and I think we can do that and a lot of times we put that below the signature that we have enough space that's just something I've been doing recently where we keep the main email nice and sweet it's like there's more information below my signature if you want to talk let's talk just so you can get a longer email but you could also get away with um you could get a longer email but you could get away with it still feeling kind of short and the only people who read the signature are the people who were interested above so anyway and then the other thing that we're playing around with is is not talk about the mechanism all not like not even telling people that his Facebook ads not even telling people that we run a CFO service like none of that literally just the outcome and and not saying anything about how that outcome is accomplished there was another company we were working with that we were more having an email deliverability problem um because of inboxes that they had set up but because so I didn't want to mention this but I guess I'll mention it just because I don't have clearly defined results here I had like a glimmer of hope with this we were um we were basically emailing e-commerce Brands and we were saying hey you know I imagine your average order value is blank if people order these products and then we would name the products so it was like I imagine your average order value is around 120 bucks if people order this product this product and this product and we would name it and then we would say um I know similar web isn't accurate all the time but considering on similar web you get 40,000 monthly website visitors doing that math we help people increase Revenue by 1 to 3% so I think we can help people you increase revenue from like $8,000 $15,000 whatever that math turns into the way we do this is um we have like a pixel that can de anonymize the people who didn't fill out their abandoned card flow or who didn't identify themselves in the workflow would you want to chat and uh that didn't really get a whole lot of responses but when we took out the deanonymization part and then we even Chang the first line because no human would ever say anything like that um so then we also changed the first line to be something more like I was looking at product one product two product three and my order came to be about $120 that was long enough that the preview text got taken up um so it looked like a a support email and then we just went into the the rest of it and so we had email deliverability problems we also didn't get that many positive responses from the campaign before this customer started stopped working with us U but it's just another one to just show that we did take away the mechanism on this and we made that other first line change as well too uh but it was getting more responses than anything else we were getting at the time positive responses too and so that's just a little bit more proof on this so I just wanted to make this video to a little bit document it so that I could come back to this video but also possibly start a conversation with others who could be thinking about this too um where basically we have our straight down the middle we say one sentence about the mechanism we say a case study about the mechanism and and I think that's the down the-middle campaign and I think we're going to be testing more campaigns where we get into the nitty-gritty of this this is how refined we are um and then we also talk on the complete side where we don't even talk about the mechanism at all we just talk about how we accomplish our outcomes and we lean into our case studies even more and things like that and so um I hope this maybe starts a conversation somebody else is Poss thinking about this help hopefully it helps your outbound campaign to think about this we're on the early days of seeing this help with our positive response wordss on some of our campaigns and so I figured it was we had enough proof to put it out there and start talking about it so um let me know what you think let me know what you think of this style of video where I have no visuals or anything I'm just talking out of camera um this is what I am spending a lot of my time thinking about which is why I created a video so um let me know if uh this Sparks any ideas for you all\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Chat GPT 3.5 vs. 4.0 First Look Reaction for Sales Pros

hey everyone in this video we are going over something extremely exciting this is a video about my initial thoughts of the difference between chat GPT 3.5 versus 4.0 and so we have both of them in this clay table and we're going to go in and figure out what we think the differences would be so I already have a lot of content pieces and chats going with chat GPT and before we dive into the actual examples I just wanted to give some of my high level thoughts immediately my first overview of the difference between 3.5 and 4.0 is that 3.5 uh well I guess a 4.0 does a much better job of giving you the results in the context that you actually want which we're going to go into in a little bit 4.0 does also a much better job of evaluating complex asks um like a little bit later we're going to go over uh hey this company's hiring for this job title what does that mean and how is that job title going to help them fulfill on their company Mission 4.0 does a much better job of that and then also it is just far more creative I asked it to do something pretty unique as far as giving businesses ideas on how to use clay as a product and it came out with much better results when we did that and so one thing that I didn't do with any of these chat GPT Integrations is I did not have a chat with it I didn't train it at all it's just the raw output from what we were doing so we have some of these example companies here that we all basically know these companies Salesforce Red Bull gong one password ocean test box seamless Zoom you know gymshark brex taplio we and I put all these companies so that we could switch back and forth and basically already have an understanding of what the company does so the first thing that I did was I generated what is the mission statement of the company using chat topt 3.5 and I use 4.0 so if we look at Salesforce it says bringing companies and customers together on a number one CRM to change the world for good but see how it says mission in the front there let's check out 4.0 connecting companies you know and customers to the number one CRM for Global change pretty similar but see how like I was saying in the beginning of the video we don't want it to say Mission I don't want it to put quotes I don't want it to say ocean.o's mission right it just gets straight to the point so again you see how we have ocean.io's Mission hyper targeted B2B sales and marketing through prospecting right and then here it gets straight into it right away so that's one thing that I really appreciate see the mission of one signal empowering businesses with omnichannel messaging to create many meaningful customer connections one signal aims to empower businesses without you know it just gets straight into what we actually want and there's less mistakes that if you were to use this you don't have to do as much cleaning and sifting through the information the next thing I did is I looked for companies who are hiring for open job roles and I didn't put any filter on it I just let it rip and just wanted to see what it would come back with uh and as you can see so the question I made here of let's show the prompt on this one so we did two messages I basically said you're an assistant helping me write sales emails to potential customers I guess I should have put emails but we won't change it now and I said I will give you two inputs the first will be a company description and the second will be a job title create one sentence about how hiring this job title would help the company move towards fulfilling their mission this is the company description and this is the job title that they're hiring for and I gave them both of those pieces of information and so let's see Red Bull oh let's bring our companies along with us for the ride okay so Red Bull wants to hire a student marketer at George Mason University 3.5 says hiring a student Mark tier oh that's funny oh they said marketeer okay at George Mason University would it help Red Bull fulfill their mission of giving Wings to people and ideas by creating a stronger presence and building brand awareness among college students okay pretty good by and then this is gpt4 uh by hiring a student marketeer at George Mason University Red Bull will effortlessly expand its innovative presence and influence within the Campus Community further driving the mission of giving Wings to people and ideas in more than 170 countries so a little bit more specific uh I would say these were actually pretty similar if we get right down to it um let's see hiring a community outreach coordinator can help Outreach fulfill their mission by developing and executing a strategic plan to engage and educate potential customers about their system of action which in turn can lead to increased sales opportunities and revenue growth and then let's go over here to gpt4 whoops hiring a community outreach coordinator one would further boost outreach's mission of powering sales success by effectively engaging with local communities increasing brand awareness and fostering meaningful relationships ultimately contributing to even greater results and revenue growth for your esteemed company so one thing that I want to note here is that it really took the context of the community outreach coordinator into what the actual job was going to be doing here it doesn't really get into the fact that Community is a way that people will drive results here it did not sure if that's just a roll of the dice or what it might be but it was it did mention that community outreach were there let's look at C let's see another one okay so gymshark hiring an assistant merchandiser will help gymshark better manage and optimize inventory levels ensuring that our products are always available to inspire individuals to achieving something extraordinary so I would switch to first person there our products right by hiring an assistant merchandiser Jim shark will further streamline their product management process ensuring that their Innovative Fitness offerings continue to Aspire Inspire and Empower individuals across the globe to achieve extraordinary Feats again the small difference here but this would kill you in an outbound campaign if you actually mentioned it say they say uh our products are always available and here we're speaking and saying their Innovative Fitness offerings and things like that keeping the contacts the same so you know pretty similar outputs I would say nothing revolutionary but gpt4 does do a better job of processing the information and you know turning that into things that you'd actually be able to send so now here this is probably my favorite one that to show off and I can't wait to work on this even more essentially with this I gave a little bit of a context of what clay does as a company and I basically said hey using this company's subscription how would we build a list for this company and how would we help them with our product um and give some ideas in a bullet point fashion so I literally said we run a software uh that helps companies build creative lists of prospects consider the company's description and create a plan of how we would help them grow this is the company's subscription great answer in three bullet points with one sentence in each bullet point mention creative data points we could search for to build interesting lists for company basically building lists for who is in the most need for their product or service so now what I found with this is you'll find that sometimes GPT 3.5 gives ideas but it keeps it pretty General GPT 4 gets right into the meat of it and it does a really really good job of that and so if I can find some of these while we're on the video that would be great because I was looking for them we'll look at this one right oh so what company is this let's go back this is help desk let's bring all of the companies over so we can see whoops okay so email pitch for help desk as a first step we would help identify it and CRM professionals who frequently face challenges with help desk management and CRM software using social media listening and online forums not a bad idea we could build a list of companies struggling to streamline their itsm and CRM processes by analyzing their website analytics and identifying areas for improvement in their customer support processes our team could identify potential clients that have rapidly expanding businesses and may require a more comprehensive help desk and CRM software solution to scale blah blah blah blah not bad let's look at what four came out with bullet point one oh that's not great I wish it didn't say that identify businesses with high volume of customer interactions or it related issues by tracking social media complaints and analyzing customer support ratings as these companies May greatly benefit from help desks software Solutions see way way more in depth right right away much better idea well it might be the same idea but it gives way more context to the idea Target startups and small to medium-sized businesses and growth industries such as e-commerce or technology as they are likely to need efficient and comprehensive help desk and CRM software to manage their ryzen customer base and it requirements not a bad idea bullet point three focus on companies that are currently using outdated or inefficient help desk systems by researching online forums and review platforms as these platforms may be or as these businesses may be actively seeking new and improved software solutions to better manager ID and customer support needs awesome um so you see how it just gets much more into the weeds of everything so let's take another one let's just grab kajabi so this is Chachi PT 3.5s ideas for how clay would be able to help kajabi identify and Target knowledge entrepreneurs who are currently using multiple platforms and tools and showcase how kajabi's all-in-one knowledge become murderous platform can simplify their business operations uh creative data points search for those who are currently using other e-learning course creation platforms teachable and thinkific those who have recently started a coaching or mentorship business those who frequently post about online courses or knowledge products on social media not bad even 3.5 that's really not a bad idea I just don't like and in a lot of ways we would fix this formatting uh if it came down to it uh by just chatting back and forth with it of exactly what we want reach out to Industry experts and influencers who are willing to promote or recommend kajabi to Their audience creative data points search for those who are with a large following on social media and frequently post about e-learning or online course creation those who have a successful coaching or membership business those who are currently using kajabi and have positive reviews I can't wait for chat 4.0 puts out because these are actually great great ideas utilize content marketing to showcase the success stories of kajabi's clients and how the platform has helped them achieve creative data points search for kajabi clients who have been successful in growing their business using the platform those who have unique or interesting businesses language learning courses DIY courses art courses those who have a large following of social media and you can share their success With Their audience not bad all right very excited to see what 4.0 comes out with all right so again this is kajabi target audience compile a list of knowledge entrepreneurs course creators and coaches in various Fields who are primarily using multiple or fragmented platforms to manage their online presence and showcase how kajabi's all-in-one platform can fit their needs now for the big difference here I like how and maybe this is getting picky but notice how 4.0 actually put in the type of people that kajabi wants to Target right there that I would say is the biggest difference here keyword based potential clients identify individuals and businesses using search engine and social media queries related to online course creation e-learning platforms membership management and other related terms indicating that there are possible need for kajabi services okay so it's basically pitching Google ads okay we'd have to train it a little bit more on on what clay does Market gaps research underserved Industries and dishes that could benefit from kajabi's platforms such as small Niche online communities and specialized skills training programs allowing kajabi to enter markets with limited competition not a bad idea as well uh so that one's pretty good I'm gonna go over one one more and then we'll take it from there let's do one password what list ideas did chat TPT come up with for one password we'd start by identifying companies that have recently hired new employees as they likely need to set up new accounts and need added password and data security measures not a bad idea that's really good I I hope one person's password is doing that we'd also look for companies that have experienced any recent data breaches or cyber attacks as they would benefit from our clients Protection Systems Great yeah that's true additionally we would search for companies with a remote Workforce as password and data management can become more challenging with a diverse team nice that that's really really good and that's from 3.5 that's awesome all right here we go Target businesses using multiple SAS platforms compile lists of companies that use a variety of software tools and platforms indicating a higher need for an efficient I am and password management solution great focus on companies with remote and hybrid teams identify organizations to promote or hybrid work setups as these businesses tend to rely heavily on these digital tools and make them ideal prospects for one password really really good leverage data on security oh whoops leverage data on security breaches research and include companies that recently were a part of them and blah blah blah so again similar ideas but in chat gpt4 it goes more into the the weeds of it and so this is just to the beginning of our exploration I literally just wanted to create this announcement tell everybody that 4.0 is in clay now I'm going to do a lot more playing around with it but as you can see there's some pretty major differences here 3.5 and 4.0 might have similar outputs but 4.0 is just so much better fleshed out the formatting is better the ideas are better it's more creative it handles complex tasks better it's just all around phenomenal and so uh yeah thanks for watching this video and keep on following for more updates about what we find for using chat GPT in outbound prospecting\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Clay.com Overview of Integrations

so for this video buckle up uh we're going to go over the Integrations inside of clay I probably won't cover every single integration because there are quite a lot I'm going to really highlight the ones that I use the most often or the ones that I going to tell you hey double click into this and and check these out because they're really really good and so of course to enter the Integrations we just hit enrich data and this opens up all of the Integrations for us now there's a lot of things right off the top from here there's a search bar there's a lot of different things that you can do we're going to click on providers so that we can go through this in the easiest way possible and so the first one air table this is just a database there's no enrichments that you could do here this is essentially uh what allows you to do is to just add records um into your Air table databases then we have Apollo Apollo Apollo is rough because Apollo's API key limits are so low on most people's accounts that there's really not a whole lot that you can do I personally have an Enterprise account with Apollo and my API limits are ridiculously low and so I don't use Apollo as an integration inside of clay because I I barely can really use it um often and so but Apollo allows you to do all these things artificial intelligence this is oh that's Cent I guess whoops where it is okay so open AI is what I thought we would get into so this is an open AI API key into just blank open AI so when you want to do your AI message writing or have ai do something for you we're going to get there's going to be a whole module on on how we use AI bright data honestly I don't use it that often uh I actually I've never used it inside of clay so don't worry about that one builtwith this is phenomenal if you want to know what technologies a company is using inside of their stack builtwith is the go-to platform in order to do this um if so you want to know like how the sausage is made with some of these data companies so that you know the way that like if you don't get results back you know what's going on so we've built with what they're doing is they're pinging the website and they're looking what technology is installed on that website so if the website is built on webflow builtwith is going to be able to pick that up for you if the technology if the website um so if you're looking for QuickBooks though as a we as a technology and built with they're not really going to have that because people don't install Quickbooks on their website there's not really a reason to and so I see a lot of people their biggest mistake with using builtwith is they think that they can get these technologies that companies are using and they really can't um because they don't install it onto their website now I'm going to jump there's another plat data platform or data integration on here called predict leads and predict leads can help find a Tex stack and the way they're doing that is with the historical job descriptions and so if you don't so if you're hiring for an accountant and you want them to have knowledge with QuickBooks you're going to put in your job description hey this person needs to have qualifications with QuickBooks predict leads can help you find the the data in there and so um as far as finding Technologies those are basically the two ways to do it capterra this is not an actual Capa enrichment there is a scraping company called Zen Rose where um they Zen Rose is powering the scrape behind this but if you put a uh company inside here right this company domain then it can go out and uh enrich their capter data which is really really really great stuff and then you have Clay and clay enrichments and Clay formatters these are the three that I think you should really double tap into and just take a look on your own because there's a lot of free Integrations in here that do really interesting things like finding the sit map of URLs um count occurrence of items in like a text or List generate email perm like there's a lot of stuff in here just check it out because a lot of times people want to solve problems for themselves and they don't know how to do it and often times there's a free um integration inside of clay and then there's clay enrichments so find latest fundraising data find site traffic find personal emails and social URLs find Mobile numbers and find latest Revenue data and then this is find email this is just like an \[Music\] for a lot of my first searches so for like fine sight traffic I'll use this because it's super cheap to get it done but um you know don't expect like the best coverage out of out of those clay form matters you should check out um as well and double tap into that let's see clearbit to be completely honest the only thing I really use clearbit for because it's just so expensive the only thing I really use clearbit for is find domain from company name so if you have a list of company names and you need their website to enrich them for other things I use clearbit because it's totally free to find the website of the company name and um I'll start with that one and then I'll use Google after it and so then close that's not really going to enrich anything but um that's how you just add data to your CRM contact out they have really good personal email data from LinkedIn a little bit expensive but for personal emails it's very very good customer IO again you're just basically adding data to the platform D radar I've never used dagma um there find work email is really good to find email addresses and then their mobile numbers are very good they're just the most expensive on the platform but the the mobile numbers are very very very good debounce is a email validation tool never send uh if you like download leads from like another data source always use a tool to clean them up um dagma will clean up those leads for you I'm not sure if drop contact does but dagma find email prosio all of those that it's totally fine to send emails to them um drop contact we went over that and enriches the person to find their email address and then let's look at this G2 again this is enriching the company on G2 via zenr so that you can go find their their like their reviews and things like that GitHub you can find user details you could find email from a username you could find their summary really great if you're doing if you're targeting technical people or you're trying to recruit technical people Google this is the most slept on integration we're going to do an entire just section on just Google cuz so when we're doing this information right A lot of times when you're manually doing these tasks you're Googling a lot of these things and so Google has built the world's biggest scraper you just need to know how to harness it and so there's a couple things inside of the Google integration like finding open jobs performing a search finding keywords in a website Business Review information all this stuff we're going to basically focus on performing a search but this is one of my favorite favorite Integrations on Clay there's going to be a whole um a whole module I'm just doing that so we'll get jump down Google shopping exactly what it sounds like you can get Google shopping results um good if you're like targeting e-commerce Brands Google News really great for finding company news Google page speed this is free just to see you know how fast their speed is going Google Scholar I've never used that Google Sheets is just integrating with Google Sheets Hacker News just an integration just pulling topics off of Hacker News harmonic harmonic is probably one of my favorite databases although it's pretty pricey um so I'm not going to go into it because most people won't have access and if you do have access to it you know exactly what it does HubSpot CRM Hunter enriching emails Instagram this helps find the company profile given the company's domain so uh if you want to get like how many followers they have and stuff you're going to have to use a Google Search and we'll go over that a little bit later and then let's see here LM list instantly these both just add data to your accounts basically linear I've never used LinkedIn this is like worth just taking a pause and just looking at all of these because they have such great information on here that you just you just want to check it out so like finding companies um finding active jobs finding contacts all of these are really really great just take a look run them yourselves it's GNA there's great data in here for LinkedIn data and then let's see here lob never use Lucia you need your own API key um so if you have your own API key you know what that does mapbox mix rank essentially helps find a personal email address or if you have a personal or work email address and you want to connect that to a LinkedIn profile uh mixrank can help you do that let's see never bounce is a tool kind of like debounce um nimbler email enrichment finding people they have mobile numbers they have personal emails that's a good enrichment um let's see open AI we're going to do a lot with Outreach is just basically adding contacts ower I would even not even like jump into this much it's so expensive for the data and it's really not like we there's cheaper ways to get the same exact data then let's see padd they've got really sophisticated data on accounts and we're going to talk about them probably later people data Labs great mobile phone numbers for some reason I don't know how they haven't really figured out email addresses in my opinion really great mobile phone numbers they've got some cool data I would just check them out they're they're a really good data provider um let's see pitchbook is via Zen Rose as well Phantom Buster uh not as used pipe drive just adding context predict leads is another one to double tap into this is how you find most recent news you find Tex deack you find open jobs and then finding connections I've never really gotten this one to work but it's like you can find people who are like you know customers or investors or vendors of a company and and things like that um let's see prosp really great email enrichment tool Salesforce sales Loft basically just adding data inside of them um scrap magic I'm not even sure if it's supported anymore um like the founder of scrape magic I'm not sure if that he supports it Shopify this is really great if you're targeting Shopify stores and you want to find the products on there you could also check to see if it's you know Shopify hosted which if you pull a list of Shopify stores you already know but then you can find what products they host and that's really really great for targeting Shopify stores signal hire um B basically this is like enriching them like a LinkedIn URL and you could get their email address and their phone number and things like that um slack is really good I like to just like send custom messages to myself like based off of like a web hook and maybe we'll go into that smart lead email sequencing tool snav email addresses they're okay um snowflake database store leads enriching e-commerce companies um stripe I didn't even know that this integration existed Summit swordfish Twitter type form Yelp Yelp I use to like there's one play that like everybody kind of is like wow Eric that was really smart candidly I got it from um line. but like everybody is like oh Eric came up with this I'm like no no no I like didn't come up with this and so basically I love to add like if I'm targeting local businesses I love to add in the PS section like oh hey by the way have you tried the steakhouse um you know I'm pretty sure I heard of it on the Food Network and it looked really good and we'll use Yelp to pull you know a steakhous in the area and that one's pretty good Zen Rose is like there's going to be a whole module on Zen Rose um not not just inside of clay but like outside of clay because it's just such a great um scraping tool and then zero bounce as the email validation tool and so uh we're going to dive a lot deeper when we go into workflows when we go into examples and all these kind of things but hopefully this gives you a quick overview of kind of what you're working with inside of clay there's a lot of ways to get people's mobile numbers there's a lot of ways to do research on companies there's a lot of ways to do research on people this is the overview of um all of those and and how to get it done so

\# Guide to Boost Responses by 22% using GPT-4 for Marketing Agencies

hey everyone in this video I'm gonna go over how we're gonna use gpt4 in order to generate the email copy so that all four emails in a sequence are uh personalized and so we're going to go over the copy first and then we're going to go over to the clay table to talk about how we can actually build it and so this is for a marketing agency and so we're going to lead off with hey I noticed on LinkedIn that you recently started leading marketing at company name this is if they've been there for less than a year and I noticed on LinkedIn that you've been leading marketing at company for years as the title gleaned by AI um this is if they've been there for longer than a year and so then we'll be like I did some further digging on similar way I've installed that companies like competitor are taking some of the same digital real estate keywords and space your company ranks for uh one of the very first things we do is we help like companies like Airbnb and hotjar and we help them execute custom marketing plans when they don't have the team band or their expertise to do so would it be worth a chat or a company name awesome uh then we're gonna go back we're gonna do a little bit of create of ideas Outreach so we'll say I was back on your site today and some marketing ideas for you and then we'll go into this and then I'll say but of course I wrote this without knowing anything about your current bottlenecks and goals if it's interesting to you we could hop on a call and I'd be happy to share what's working in the industry uh industry for other companies especially in the harmonic keywords Niche we also might take that from LinkedIn and then we'll send this email I was just taking a look at your company profile uh all this information and then we'll do a pixel sentence talking about hey like I know that you're running ads or I know that you're not running ads you'll see and then we'll just end with this email here which we I'll probably do a customization on the Fly because I thought we had something here um we might do something like um is taking all your time uh should I reach out to other person at company not the same person um because they seem to be leading marketing as well right so we'll put that in and would it be useful if I sent this over uh nope we don't need that great so now we'll go to the clay table and talk about how we built all of these so the first thing that we need is the uh title and like when they started right so we see all this data this is all the clay table we verified the emails made sure that if we couldn't find a valid email we'll get another one over here and we have a master email column here we're cleaning up the the names and then we're using this formula here well actually first we've enriched the LinkedIn profile so that we can get all the data on the LinkedIn profile in clay we get their summary all of their past experience somebody probably has more experience than that the all of their past experiences where they worked what's their title uh the domain is it current all of these different things and so what we'll do is we used an AI formula over here to see if the start date is from uh less than a year ago and so these are all false uh and so then nobody would fit for that criteria so then we have uh over here we normalize the date because the output from their latest experience comes in at like 1986 1001 and I'm never going to reach out like that so I want it to say October in 1986 and so we normalized that and then I cleaned their title using artificial intelligence um I'm okay with this one saying founder and automation specialist I wonder what they say um founder automation specialist yeah I we we could improve this and I'll do this on the Fly is so um we basically say hey clean these job titles so they don't include useless information these are the job titles to review then we have all of these and I'm just gonna put in founder automation \[Music\] specialist and then I'm going to just train it down here for that when it says uh founder automation specialist it'll just say founder and then we'll train it like that and then we just input we'll say clean the title so they don't include useless information these are the job titles to review and then we only want this uh to run if we have a title from their LinkedIn profile so then we'll let that run we want to see this one get fixed I wonder if this will get chopped down to yeah wow that's crazy that it did that hmm I wonder what it's making do that well I could troubleshoot this if you ever are getting incorrect uh prompts out of artificial intelligence you just need to keep messing with it until you get exactly what you want um what I do like about this is they put founder comma automation specialist at least now this is founder and automation specialist looks a little bit better when you reach out to them then we have this formula here where uh if basically I'm saying if new column contains false concatenate I noticed on LinkedIn that you have been leading marketing at company name and since and then the date and then the title um or if this is true which means that they've been at the company for less than a year we're going to alternate the line so see all these people haven't been there for a year so now we're saying I noticed on LinkedIn that you've been leading marketing at Deirdre J automation architect since March 2009 as the founder and automation specialist I noticed that you've been leading marketing at Ben Hansen Architects since oh we don't have the input here interesting so we'd have to remember that uh when we are sending all of this data to our sequencing tool so anyway that's how we would get through this first line here and get that either or the way we're going to get the competitors I already said we got it from similar web so we're going to scrape similar web using Google searches so uh Google has built the world's greatest scraper uh and you just need to get access to it and so you can use the Google search enrichment inside of clay in order to tap into that and so uh this is what our Google search looks like it's just site similarweb.com in url and then we have the normalized uh title and then we have competitors in there as well so that it comes up in the snippet and then if you look at the results here we have the snippet down here as well and so you'll see the first one is clavio which for gong it's not like totally a competitor but that's why I head to my bets and I was like look like they're competing for the same keyword space that you are foreign and then let's be here oh okay so now we've gotten through these emails and now we're into the creative ideas email so if you've been following me and my other videos I love doing this one where basically we'll take their company description and I train it and I give them um ideas so basically we're saying you know using the input create three marketing ideas based on the input uh which is a company description there's the description keep the outputs under 15 words per bullet point and use keywords from the input to build creative ideas and so then I literally just pass it like company descriptions as examples and then what would I say if I saw those company descriptions I put them right into here uh inside of Converse which at2bt inside of clay and then it gives us pretty good outputs so they're saying like do a social media challenge a pay-per-click campaign Facebook ads all of this stuff so that we can fill out this section right here which is super super awesome and then we'll keep moving on where then we have the uh Facebook oh so then we have the industry and then the harmonic keywords so what I like I like mentioning the industry because I feel like people it's a nice touch but if you reach out to somebody you say you're in the marketing and advertising industry I know you pulled that from LinkedIn but then I want to add this Niche thing here so that um uh so that they are like oh maybe they did look me up because it's often overlooked and so we can go in a harmonic and we can take the niche keywords um but then we also have the Specialties from enrich companies that one didn't have it but so like this one has the Specialties right so architectural drawings architectural renderings like uh all of these Specialties would be good ones to name so I just mapped the the first one from there and so then we could just have a merge column and so we'll just go like zero one and then we'll go zero so we're basically saying you know if this has data in it I want that one it but if this is empty and this is uh full then we'll take that one so you'll see like we'll get marketing automation restoration we'll get nothing here we'll get Executive coaching here we'll get our architectural drawings here we're gonna get service and then here we're gonna get B2B so we'll just hit that and then we can combine it all into just one sheet so now we've completed this line and now we need to do this company pixel sentence and so basically I want to be able to say hey I looked at your website and saw that you have a Facebook pixel or hey I looked at your website I saw you don't have a Facebook pixel you don't have a custom audience or anything like that so the first way that we check for this is we use built with and we're checking for all of these keywords in their technology profiles um and we just want to know if any of those Technologies exist so then we have Facebook pixels here and then we have a custom formula so we're saying if new column is empty concatenate I use the built with Chrome extension and didn't see any custom audiences or pixel tracking on your site would you like to discuss your uh current growth channels I think we can change this to something better though but please take this video as advice on automation not necessarily copywriting or if new column is not empty concatenate I use the built with Chrome extension and sorry we're using some and then Tech I just wanted to make it sure that it would fit anyway how's it going running ads to acquire customers right and so then you can see like for Facebook pixel I use the builds with Chrome extension and Saria using Facebook pixel Tech how is it going running ads to acquire customers and then if there's nothing I use the built with Chrome extension and didn't see any custom audiences or pixel tracking on your site and so it just changes everything there so now I guess I forgot to build into the workflow or do the copywriting for the fourth one so this will be fun I'll build it live on the video so we'll say alternative alternatively if working with companies taking all your time should I reach out to other person uh at the company not this person because they seem to be leading marketing as well so the way we're going to do this is we'll use the find people Integrations we'll just hit find people and so we'll hit this and we're just going to map the LinkedIn company URL right here and then for job title keywords I'm going to put um like head of marketing well actually you know what yeah we need to put like Chief marketing officer head of marketing while I type this I'm actually going to pause the video so honestly I just had to PT come up with all these titles and so then we'll just check um if they're there and we don't really need locations um and then nope so basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna do we're gonna pull all of these people so let's of course there's no people at the company um okay so I'm just gonna pause and fill out a company where this is definitely uh going to be true actually let me see nope hang on okay so now we've returned 10 profiles and so what we basically need to do though is we want to be one thousand percent sure that when we reach out to this person and so we will let's make an example when we reach out to Kristen right so we'll we'll put the name Kristen over there I want to make sure that we're not reaching out to Kristen right I want to Target like Laura right so what we're going to do is we'll say like okay this is the name uh we don't actually we only need a first name but that's totally fine and so now what we'll do is now that we have this name here we're going to say okay this is the person we're reaching out to if it double finds people we we want that to not not be the case and so now what we're going to do is we can map the first person's name and we can map the second person's name because it you know if the second person is the accidentally the person that we're already reaching out to that's fine we'll just take the first person and if uh you know the first person is the person we're accidentally reaching out to we'll just take the second person and so now we'll just hit formula and I'll say um if full name contains return the data from um or if first name does not contain this one um first name does not contain this one return the data from great and we'll hit this formula just so that we're like a thousand percent sure I'm write this out and it's not going to give it to us because this is 11\. so wait what the heck let me just pause and fix this okay so this took more time than I thought but basically I just used a get keywords function on the column and then I looked for first name which is all the way at the beginning of the table over here and so I basically said is first name in this name and then uh then we get this output here of the keyword found and then I basically just wrote you know if keywords found is not empty output the name which if it's not empty that means we need the second person or if keyword is found output the first person's name and so then we got it and then we can even try this we could say like Julia for number five put this in here Julia oh and then it's gonna queue and then yeah I just want to hit and then see how we have this new column over here so then this would be the person we'd reach out to so now we'd be able to say you know uh hey should I reach out to you know Eric nosowski because they seem to be leading marketing as well we could also take you know their title and do something with artificial intelligence too but uh yeah so this is the full workflow that you can use so that now you don't have to just only personalize the first email you can personalize all of your follow-ups and make your cadences look a lot more human uh so as always you can reach me on LinkedIn if you have any questions and I hope you enjoy the video thanks very much\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

in the previous video of this series we went over a couple of websites that you can use to get fund fundraising information about accounts this video is going to be dedicated to the actual workflow and actually being able to reach out to these people automatically so we're going to go over a basic workflow where you don't have a lot of manipulation but if you're just getting started it's really really easy for you to Target these companies and then we'll talk about a more advanced workflow using clay.com that once you set it up you'd be able to just receive fundraising information and then just set it you know just download it and then just do it once a month and you'd have your whole campaign targeted so uh the easy simplest way to get a list of companies that are raising money and then find the people at those companies that you want to Target is with apollo.io and so we have Apollo in front of us and from our last video we were looking for companies where their last funding stage was series B and when they raised was October 16th to today so we have this company list in front of us we just use the fundraise information in Apollo and so there's some in here that really don't make sense to be quite honest like price bhouse Cooper that's just probably not true and so the way that we can clean up this list a little bit from companies that don't make sense is using the employee headcount filters so we'll just turn all of these on for companies that are going to fit for us and then we'll just go to the saved category and we're going to hit select all companies and then we'll just click find people now let's say I want to reach out to the people who are the uh VPS of sales at these companies so I'm going to put Vice President of Sales boom now we have our list what I would do is I would spend more time making this list a lot easier probably make sure that the uh person location is in the United States as well and now you'd have a list of all these companies that raised money in the past six months for a series B all in the United States and this is the VP of sales I might try other keywords like actual VP of sales uh head of sales just things to make sure that you know you broaden out your search and you can get more people and so like I said this is the easy basic way kind of easiest way to get it done the way that you could do this and automate it more is by combining harmonic with Clay which is my personal favorite way to to get this done and so in harmonic I just like monic because they probably have the best fundraising information of anyone and so we're going to take this list and we're going to add um a country to it so we're just in the United States and so if you're using crunch base if you're using Apollo if you're using anything where the output is going to give you a list of websites this is still going to work uh or a list of LinkedIn company URLs it's it's all still going to work so just take this as more of like a a reference of you know another way to do this so we're just going to export this and while that's exporting I'm going well we don't even have to go to Clay just yet uh so let's just let that export so now we're ready to import inside of clay I'm just going to use import data from CSV and I'm going to take our spreadsheet I'm going to hit new blank table complete import okay great and so what we're going to do here is we are going to uh fund raise example and so we have information about these companies here and we have all of these websites we've got about 500 websites maybe a couple more and what we want to be able to do is turn these websites into leaders and so there's two ways that we could get this done we could use clay and we could hit find contacts at company where we'd then be able to map in the website and then we could look for all the job titles we could also use this button up here called find people which is essentially going to do the same thing for us but the only problem with find people is we won't be able to uh set up an automation where I could just take a list of 500 websites completely just upload them into um clay and then just have like an automated workflow working for us but what we can do is we could use this to set up our table so what we're going to do and believe me just follow along I know it's a little bit crazy so we're going to hit don't save and we're just going to hit find people so this is called fundraise example we have that and then we're just going to hit Vice President of Sales great so now we have the Vice President of Sales we want them to be located in the United States so what this is going to do is now we're going to get a preview what this is going to do is it's going to allow me to create another table uh where we found all of these people and so great 50 out of 70 people to import which for series B company that kind of makes sense cool and so now we're just going to let this load in and so let's say that the thing that we want to automate is basically we want to automate finding their email address and we want to um know we let's let's just find their email address so we're going to hit find work email so for their full name we'll map their full name and then for their company domain we'll get this include catch all email results prospo we can trust so we'll do that and so now we're going to just go out and find their email addresses and then I'll just map this really quickly great and then they are nice enough to give us a first name as well so I'm going to take advantage of that while I have it great and so now we have everyone's first names and email addresses here and what we can do is we can go ahead and we can run this and then let's say that we just want another setup where we just want to um we want to send a personalized first line to them so we'll just enrich the company with the uh LinkedIn company URL I don't suppose we have that nope I guess use the the website whoops we'll use the company domain and then we'll run this and then we'll just take the description and then we'll just use the preset inside of clay and there's one called Mission this is available to everybody use a company to write a company Mission to write the first email line we'll get that done uh this is my mistake I need to change this you don't need the quotes great oh whoops now we can save this and we'll let it run okay so now up until this point you might be saying like Eric like how is this automated like what are you talking about and this is the point that we're going to automate uh well actually I guess we need one more thing so then we'll connect this to our smart lead account add lead to campaign refresh Fields fundraise example campaign and then we'll just map everything out which uh I'm just going to put their email and their first name nothing well I guess I'll put the custom name as well all right I guess you're going to see more than I thought so we'll keep going and then we'll just say like first line okay and we're going to save and not run that so now you might be saying okay like why why are we doing it this way the reason why we're doing it this way is because now what we have the capability to do is we can go to our original table which accepts all of those oh no not that one it takes in all of the websites right take the fundraise example so this takes all of our websites in here and what we can do now is Clay has set up for us our find people search yep and I guess this would just oh this would send the data over for us okay great and so now what we can do though is we could set up a right to table integration which we could have started with a right to table integration but it would have been easier uh like we would have had to set up our whole table and everything so what we're going to do is we'll start with remember how I said the find contact ta that company we're going to use that now again the whole reason why I didn't use it in the beginning is cuz then you'd have to set up your whole table and workflow and everything um using right to table and I find that to to be a little tough sometimes so we'll do the exact same search and we'll hit Vice President of Sales and we'll say the United States and we can hit continue to add fields and we'll run this oops and I know not every company has these people which is totally fine and we have this return one profile right here which is essentially all that we need so we're going to open that up and then we'll hit take action on list and we're going to click write each item to a new row in other table and so the other table that we're going to hit is going to say fund raise 2 find people from fundrais table excellent and now we can add our objects which now I'm just going to add in in uh the like the first name the full name and everything from here so just give me a second and now I have all of these things mapped so what I can do is I can hit save and run first 10 rows and then we'll get this vital person added to the bottom of the table see how we have one row created and so then we'll come over here and you can see we have this this row created at the bottom let's just bring it all the way down so we have this person right now the big reason why we did this is because if all you do is you just upload a list of websites and then you use find people you have to rebuild that workflow over and over and over and over again and then you have to uh like upload it hit find people and then you could import it into this table but I'm a fan of just uploading a list of websites and then just having everything run and so now if you set it up this way you can go to your table next month get the next list of companies upload just websites and so like you can even see how this would work fundraise example and so I'm just going to pick a company oh not that one I'm just going to pick a company that for sure has a vice president of sales so we'll come in here and so now I would be able to just add more data and I can just hit and Salesforce could be in here right we just hit Salesforce it runs hang it'll get there right so now we found 10 profiles now if we go to that other table now we have 10 VPS of sales at the company and we would set them up in smart lead which good thing it's not happening I think I have Salesforce blocked or something like that and so then it automatically adds to Smart lead and we don't have to think about it at all and so that is why I do it that way uh there's easier ways to do it I suppose but this is probably the most automated simplest way to get all of that done and so I hope you enjoy that video\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Launching an AI Cold Email Campaign in less than 20 minutes (Full walkthrough)

all right hey everyone I know a lot of people are requesting a full cold email campaign workflow and I'm going to try to turbocharge this workflow as fast as I possibly can we have a client who wants to reach out to manufacturing companies with 25 to 500 employees um and we want to talk to the owners Founders and the marketing leaders at those companies and then we're going to create a first line waterfall where if we detect a LinkedIn post from the person we're going to call out that LinkedIn post if we detect news about that company we're going to call out that company news and then if we don't have anything we're going to do uh just a personalized line about what the company does as far as a mission and things like that so we're going to start inside of Apollo and Apollo we're going to get really really easy filtering just done very quickly so we'll just say United States job titles owner whoops \[Music\] owner resident founder Chief marketing head marketing I don't put head of marketing um or any of those things because the way the Apollo keyword search works is it's just like you know if it's director of marketing it'll get it but then if for some reason it's a marketing director of the United States then like it'll still get it when you do it like this so we've got 1.4 million unit in the United States with job titles that we already have saved 1.7 million new um then what we are going to do is we're going to go to the employee headcount and we're going to do a custom range because they said 25 and so we'll just be a stickler about that as well 25 to 500 great so now we've whittel it down even more the employee headcount looks good over here now we're going to whittle it down to just manufactur in companies and so we're going to come in here and we're going to say uh industrial oh yeah manufacturing gets a little bit tough oh I forgot about \[Music\] that we might need to just use the keyword search so yeah we're going to have to use keywords which is fine so we'll go to company keywords I don't know why they don't keep this on automatically social media description and SEO description we should absolutely still be searching for keywords in so now we're going to go and we're going to put manufacturing as our keyword here and we're just going to see how many companies we start off with if it's enough we're not going to add any more and we'll just keep this list 50k that's good enough for me now what we need to do to to clean up this list a little bit though is uh like look at these for anything that doesn't makes sense yeah so like sometimes so you also just want to exclude like Consulting coach um legal like you you want to like you want to weed out all the people that aren't actually accounting companies they might just be like accounting I mean not accounting and manufact you want to Target companies that aren't no you want to exclude companies that aren't actually manufacturing companies and they just are like manufacturing adjacent so um like Business Services is one to take out as well I'm not going to go too deep into this but if we were to keep going I would keep exclud I would look at the keywords over here and keep finding the companies that aren't actually a good fit and exclude the keywords over here but we should have a pretty dang good list still as far as we're concerned yep 45k awesome awesome list here so we're going to go to our saved leads because we already have our saved leads there's not that many people who had job changes so we're we're good to go on this we already have the these saved leads it's free for us to pull these so we're always going to pull these first and I'm just going to pull 2500 and then the max people at the company we're going to put as five and then we're going to apply this selection and once it applies we'll just export it and then there's some like Logistics stuff that we take care of where we save them to a list so that we don't contact these people again but we're not going to talk about that right now all right so now we have the list ready to download from Apollo we're good to go we're going to bring it to Clay now and we're going to import data from a CSV import that Apollo data and so now the first thing that we need to do immediately well there's two things that like every campaign needs one we have to clean the company names and two we have to validate the email addresses so once this gets imported that's precisely what we're going to do and so we're going to call this uh fire oops fire and Spark manufacturing campaign great now we're going to go to the end and we're going to enrich the data first things first debounce clean up all these email addresses and we'll map in the email here and we only want safe to send emails so now we'll run this while that's running and we're waiting for a successful run we'll clean up the company names as well so we can get out all the llc's and everything and we'll take company name for email so that we're just cleaning an already pretty good one great then real quick and I know we're trying to do a speedrun here if you're watching any of my other videos this is intentionally very fast so watch another tutorial video If you're trying to keep up and you can't or pause and slow it down I don't know now we're just going to try to truly get as many email addresses as we can so we're going to go to dagma find work email plug in the uh person's full name and the company domain and their company LinkedIn URL so that anytime we don't have a valid email address from Apollo we can run this into tagma so the way that we run it in tagma if we all if we have an email address from Apollo and we only want to tag me to run because we had an email address from Apollo we're just going to put uh we'll just use AI actually to keep it super basic for everyone and we'll say run if and then first save to send email is empty hit generate formula it's going to be correct I know what this is okay great contact and then we will map the email like if we save and run these rows now we have um another problem to solve is that like we have emails in this column and then we're about to have emails in this column so the way that we just make sure that we have just one column of good email addresses is we use a merge column and so then we say first safe to send email and then we do email so now if there's data in this one which is this one it'll pull it into this column and there's data from dagma it'll pull it into this column we'll call this master email column so that we're all set we'll hit save settings great so now we have emails for what looks like eight out of 10 people here I don't know n wow that was terrible it's like six out of 10 I don't know why I said that so now like I said we are going to go in a waterfall where we're going to try to find we're going to try to create a personalized line uh based on the LinkedIn post of these people the company news about these people and then just generally the mission of the company and so the first thing we'll do is LinkedIn posts oops R recent post by user LinkedIn person LinkedIn post filter date we're going to do 20 20 days ago and we'll get that post and now I'm going to run this because I want as many opportunities as I possibly can to find a post yeah no one posted no so we're just going to run this on a couple of more to just find people who posted oh here's a post Okay the reason why it's important to find somebody with a post is so that the automation Works um perfectly and I don't need to like set up extra columns then remap things and forget about things and and whatever it might be so we have this post here and now we're going to use AI to create a line from it we're just going to browse our templates this is a template that I've already created use LinkedIn post to write email first line and so then we're going to say do it off of this post use template and then we'll hit save and run and so for most of these it's not even going to run because there's not enough uh criteria here which that's totally fine we're just going to run it ourselves down here and then we'll get a response over here I just wanted to reach out because I saw your post about Alliance fabrication manufacturing investment in robots excellent first line so great now we have that line now we're going to look for company news so we're going to go to predict leads and we're going to find most recent news about these companies so we'll hit domain we'll hit website and then the news found date I want it to be three uh let's say 90 days ago continue to add Fields save and run great we have this event and so we could use the whole like article body but that's going to cost a lot of AI tokens you really just need the title um hang on this is from 2019 wow but it was found at H I guess we're gonna have to live with that one to be completely honest news title hit create column great and now we're going to use AI again we're going to browse our templates and now we're going to use the template for news so now this is the news headline we're going to launch this and then finally we're going to make just the mission statement so we're going to say enrich company and we're going to get these LinkedIn company URLs mapped and now we're going to run this and I just need the description and then we're going to use AI on this one as well to create first lines from here so we hit browse templates Mission and now we'll get the company description in here and now after all of that we are ready to start putting together our actual emails so now what we want to do o I got to fix something this was my mistake this is how you fix it see how the parenthe I mean the quotes came up you just delete these quotes I you don't actually need them and this was my fault I'll tell the clay team to get rid of them you don't in back in the day I thought I needed these okay save and run first 10 rows great so now we are able to create our lines so what we're going to do is first we're going to use the merge column where we're just going to say say relevance uh relevant news well no it's like relevant post or news line and so the reason what we're going to do is we want to bring either the LinkedIn Post in here and so that's this one and then we're going to bring in the News Post here which is is this one and now we can hit save settings and see how not all of them are going to be filled in that's uh exactly what we want so now what we can do is now we're going to write a formula and we're going to say um if whoops if relevant post or newsline is not empty replace I was on your site with dug deeper on your site there we go uh from and then response to and while this is running I'll explain why so if we saw the recent LinkedIn post we need to tie that recent LinkedIn post into why we're reaching out to them if we saw the news we need to tie that news into why we're reaching out to them right and so um if we don't have anything to say to them we're going to say I was on your site and saw how you transform ideas into fully manufactured products that's what we're gonna say if we don't have a LinkedIn post and we don't have the uh the news but if we say if we're saying hey I saw the recent news article about your partnership with quick inter International heck of a great move dug deeper on your site and saw you designed sell your orchestrations that's how we're going to transition into the the email here so when we have nothing we need to say one thing but when we have a news article or a LinkedIn post we have to be able to say um something and actually yes that's exactly what we wanted to do so now we're going to hit output is correct save formula and then we're just going to have our final step here where we're just going to merge uh everything together so if if relevant post or newsline is not empty concatenate relevant poster newsline and space and response two or if we're just going to copy and paste this actually if it is empty output just response two so now again we have these conditionals where it's like okay now we're going to combine this into one cell so uh output I saw the recent news article heck of a great move I was on your site and saw oh maybe we don't want response to Oopsy Daisy we don't want response to where do we sell oh formula is where we say the Dig Deeper right so now we're going to go to formula and we're going to say dig deeper and now we'll generate this formula so now I saw the recent news article dug deeper on your site yeah that's what we wanted to say I was on your site saw you install satellite systems and plasma TVs okay great so now this is going to be email first line and now we would be ready to set this up completely but what we're going to do is we're going to make these all conditionals so the our final step which we should probably cancel the runs but it's fine our final step is we want this to only run if Master email column has data in it because if Master email column doesn't have data in it then we we're not going to reach out to these people so we don't even want it to run so we're going to come in here I'm just going to copy that and so we're going to make this this only run if Master email column has data so we're just going to put brackets oh jeez brackets Master email column whoa and that's the only reason that this is going to run and so actually we can hit run on all of it great then this is already trained to only run if there is a post with more than 30 characters so there's not going to be a post without a master email column so that's totally fine then over here we need to make this run if post is empty and master email column has data so we're going to make a formula for that run if post is empty and master email column gosh and now we would be ready now that all of this is done and we can run all of this now we are ready to integrate this with our smart lead Campaign which I don't have time to do on this video right now because I have to run to a meeting but now we would be ready to take these first lines and integrate everything with our smart lead campaign and that's how we went from Apollo to personalized Outreach inside of clay in 20 minutes\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Growth Engine X Internal Analytics Workflow

hey everyone in this video we're going to go over how we have built our internal customer analytics to monitor all of the campaigns that we're running for our customers and get early warnings on anything that we manually need to check so if you've never seen any of my videos my name is Eric nolasi I send over a million cold emails a month and when I first started my business there was a bunch of things that we would check for manually that now honestly we're at such a scale I can't check for these things manually anymore and so we have built a system to check for all of these things so if you are a person who is looking to work with us you can get a little bit of an insight into how we're going to be monitoring your campaign and we're not just relying on memory to to make sure that your campaigns are still working or if you're a cold email agency this is going to be a great video for you to see how we built the customer analytics because then you'll be able to build it for yourself for all the people who are possibly running cold email agencies I know in the past I give away the blueprints and you know you could just use the blueprints in the past I've given away very simple Blueprints and people still want me to answer questions and support them on how to use the blueprints and all of those different things so for this video I'm just going to say that we probably cannot give away These Blueprints uh because just the amount of questions that I'm going to get on using them is going to get a little crazy so with that disclaimer we're GNA head into the video so when we onboard a new customer we need to create a Cent ID for them and then once we have a client ID we need to always be monitoring every campaign that we run for them because we might run three campaigns for somebody we might run 14 campaigns for somebody and we need to be monitoring all of the analytics uh for all of these campaigns the final thing we need to monitor is sometimes if you look at a campaign on a high level if you launched a campaign three months ago and you were getting a 70% open rate then you check it again at a high level and today you're getting a 50% open rate everything could look good but until you click into it and you see oh my gosh yesterday we had a 14% open rate you wouldn't know to create new inboxes so we also need to monitor all of the campaigns uh on a alltime horizon a yesterday time Horizon a weekly time Horizon and a monthly time Horizon so that we can get a full circle view of of everything that we need to know and then there's things that we're going to get notified about uh immediately that we're going to get into so if certain criteria happens about the campaign my team and I get automated slack messages about all those things so we're just going to jump in the first thing that we do is we have an onboarding form and clickup so my stack is this is make.com we're using smart lead to send the emails and then clickup is our project management tool and then I communicate with customers on slack you could probably get away with doing this without clickup you could do the whole thing with Google Sheets I just use clickup because it's our project management tool I just got a bill for $170 and we're just going to keep using it yeah know I I like using clickup and the automations that come with it you again you could probably get away with just Google Sheets so what we do is we have them fill out a clickup form where then what we're doing is we're watching for the new task and then it you know gets the task and so in the clickup form we have a bunch of questions that we want to ask them about what kind of customers they're going after um who's their best customer who should we send emails as all of these different things when we get all of that we're going to call the smart lead API to create a new client access for them so we don't have to do it manually and then I don't have to ALS so it's very important that you create this because then down the line you Auto you want to have new clients automatically added to your databases and things like that you don't want to have to remember to do these things then we send a slack message with the new client access already uh generated so that we can give the client access to our clients and then we edit the custom field inside of clickup with the client ID so that we can tie everything back together uh again eventually and so then the next step is we have to get all the clients from Smart lead and add it to our analytics database so we have a spreadsheet up here that I'm pretty sure that you could see yes you can see this where this is a you know this is all of our client data everything that we're monitoring uh you know all this crazy stuff is in here we want to make sure that this is always the the database of Truth the database of record for all of our clients so we keep this updated so I run this automation every Monday and Thursday just because that just as often as we need to do it this um this API call lists all the client IDs that we have in smart lead and then adds them to our Master database which I'm using Google Sheets as our Master database the reason I'm not using clickup as our Master database is because there's some math that we need to get into how to do and it's easier to do that in Google Sheets than it is clickup uh unfortunately I'm not going to show all the HTTP calls because I don't want to hide all my API keys and this is going to be kind of a long video and I'm not going to make it longer so anyway again we're listing all of the client IDs with this API call and then we're making sure that they're all added to our Google Sheets we just have a filter here that if the row already exists we don't need to add it we also don't need to update it because there's no point so all it's doing is if the row already exists it doesn't pass through to this over here but if it doesn't exist then we add the row so now what we've done is we've onboarded a new client we've generated the client ID for them we have applied that client ID to our project management software and we have made sure that our source of Truth our Google sheet with all the fancy records in it always has our data uploaded as well and so now the next thing actually that we're going to get into is this is really the fancy stuff in here and so what this workflow does does this workflow basically lists every campaign that we are running so at this point we are running 425 campaigns or something like that that we're monitoring this API call lists out all of those campaigns and we get all of the campaign IDs and we search Google Sheets to see where that exists and if it exists we update the row and if it doesn't exist we add the row so we have this router here to to get all of those things done and then depending on if we added a row or we updated a row the work is the same as we go through so remember we listed all the campaigns here this first API call this is where we're getting the top level analytics of all of our um campaigns so I'm getting how many emails have we sent for the life of the campaign what's the open rate for the life of the campaign what's the response rate for the life of the campaign the bounce rate for the life of the campaign everything on this one we're getting the analytics of the campaign yesterday so how many emails did we send yesterday what was the open rate yesterday how many leads do we add yesterday what are the leads not started yesterday all of those things well no we have to get that from here you can't do leads not started for yesterday but anyway then here we are doing the last seven days so again we have a window of looking at everything in the past seven days and then here we're doing the past 30 days what we then do is we update the rows inside of Google Sheets with all the API calls that we have here if you are somebody who uses make.com you might think that you have to build this and then do an API call and then change the Google sheet and then API call and then change the Google sheet you don't have to do that just wrap it all up into one over here I will show the the Google sheet uh in a little while I just want to get done with the the make uh flows in here and so this is how we keep a huge database of of all of our customers uh well no all of the campaigns and all the analytics going on with our campaigns on an all-time basis a yesterday basis a 7-Day basis and a 30-day basis then now we have all of that data now what we need to do is we need to get all of that data into clickup so that client ID that we added when they first got onboarded uh into clickup we list all the tasks and then we're searching in Google Sheets for that client ID to be mashed up once we get that client ID what we're going to do is we're going to edit the custom Fields inside of clickup with the data that is associated with that client ID so uh essentially what's happening is again we're just listing out all of the tasks then we're searching for where that data is and then we're applying that data to the uh the clickup table over here now what you'll also see is so now this is the important part that if you are a prospective customer of growth engine X or your a cold email agency that wants to see these things this is the real reason why I built this is this filter right here where we get an automatic slack notification every day at 5:05 a.m. I get a slack notification if something is wrong with the campaign that we should be calling out immediately so if we open up this filter if the average open rate is less than 38% we get a slack notification or if your lead's not contacted is below 500 we get a slack notification if yesterday we sent less than 150 emails we get a slack notification if the open rate yesterday is below 38% we get a slack notification and if the average inbox reputation dips below 95% we get a slack notification so all of these are the most common reasons that there's going to be issues with campaigns either the inbox uh health is going down or we're just not sending enough emails for the campaigns which we immediately want to jump on top of and and get into and so we have all these automations in here to make sure that that happens then the last thing that we're doing is we also have a board where we're just watching every single campaign that we launch in its entirety completely separate so we have a client View and then we have a campaign view this is our campaign view it's much simpler all it's doing is listing all of the tasks getting the high level analytics and then just it's actually just getting the analytics for yesterday because on the campaign view that's that's all I really care about so that's how we set this one up as well and now I'm basically just going to go into the complexities of the the Google sheet where so and I'm trying not to give away all of our customers here but so you can see that these are all of the analytics that we're tracking so I have total leads through so this is client data so this is rolling up all of the campaign data and we're we have a sum of all the total leads that we have sent we have the total leads currently on their lists we have the amount of leads that are not contacted so how many more leads do we have you know in Q how many leads are in progress and how many leads have we completed all of these are all sum formulas from the total database this sum formula is basically the duct tape holding this entire table together um I had to ask chat GPT how to get this done I had no clue that this sum formula even exist I didn't even know that a sum if formula existed to be completely honest and so what this is doing is it is uniting the client ID that we have over here and in total database there is and hang on so see how in total database we have campaign IDs and then we have client IDs well there's going to be you know all of the campaign IDs are unique but the client ID is there's going to be repeats of and so what we want to do is we want to unite the numbers of all of the campaigns that have the same client ID and so that's what we're doing here is we're uniting all the numbers that have the same client ID and this is what's taking care of that so then these are all of the you know the most important metric that I look for right here is the leads not contact because I always want to make sure that we have more leads in your campaigns to always keep them full then these are our top level analytics that we always want to keep track of this is the lifetime of the campaign this is yesterday this is the last seven days and then this is the last 30 days and then we have inbox Health criteria over here so we have all the total inboxes we have our active inboxes we have inactive inboxes and we've got some math going on over here to to check the the reputation of all the inboxes and um again I would just ask chat GPT how to get this done uh literally I was putting into chat GPT like okay I have you know client IDs that are all the same in you know client data or no in total database DD I have and I'm looking for the client ID you know in B5 like I I just described it and it did did it perfectly so please do not send me a LinkedIn message asking how I did this formula um just ask chat and it's going to get it done so yeah now we have everything integrated with this database you can see like there's some things that we still need to fix so we you know it says you've exceeded the 60 data requests um what I would have to do is I just have to go into this one and just put delays inside of our our system right here to make sure that we don't go over the API calls um you know it could be like tweaked and improved a little bit but it took me a couple hours this past weekend to get this done and now this just ensures that we're going to be on top of our game so much more than we already were before and uh again if you are somebody who's looking to work with growth engine X I hope this gives you insight to how much we care about your campaigns uh and if you are a person who is running a cold email agency I hope this gives you ideas on on how you can uh do better for your customers as well and uh so with that I hope you enjoyed this video and got some good automation ideas\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Personalizing a 4 Step Email Sequence with GPT-4 for a SaaS Company

all right hey everyone in this video we're going to go over how you can use clay open Ai and uh some creativity to create an email sequence where all four of the emails have either very sophisticated AI generated content in them or they're using scraped data to make it seem extremely personal and one-to-one for uh your recipients of your message and so the first company that we'll be doing this for is a SAS company that helps people post automatically on LinkedIn and then as you can see we have two other examples that I'll be making videos on as well and so first I'm going to read the copywriting of what we'll be able to do and then I'm going to show you how it works inside of clay so that and I'm going to do it very detailed so that you can see everything happening so really quick and I know you can probably read this yourself but just so that I'm on the same page with everyone I'm gonna read it so one of your recent LinkedIn posts about and then we're going to generate it with AI seems like the last time you posted was number of days though before that though if you're trying to build your brand on LinkedIn have you considered using a scheduling tool our scheduling tool can help you write the posts and all this stuff let me know and I can send over access right so we'll be AI generating a lot about this first line email two we're gonna say Hey you know as a bump I just saw your post about and then we'll uh do another uh AI generated post it reminded me to follow up and see if you saw this so we're creating this Serendipity um of why we're following up with them email three so these emails are going to be threaded together I know I didn't write subject lines but then email three is going to be hey uh I keep seeing your content online so I made some more post ideas considering what your company does and how you promote it and then we'll use AI to generate um custom post ideas for them and they'll say this is just one example of what our AI can generate for you and you haven't even get it given it your insights yet then email four this is where we'll have a little bit more of scrape data a first name just like how Facebook pages killed their organic reach uh it can be expected that LinkedIn will do the same one day I saw your LinkedIn company page has this many followers and you had about this many followers uh as you're building your following are you maximizing the organic reach we help companies like Limitless and Outreach all that right and so we have each email here is personalized to and you know maybe the people viewing this video would disagree but personalized in a way that I think most people would not be able to sniff out that this is an automated campaign and so now we're going to jump into the clay table of how exactly we're going to build these uh these things so here we are in the clay table and so all of this is just data that we're just going to start off with uh we'll be just importing into our table the very first thing that we're going to do is we're going to verify all the emails if the emails are verified then we will move them to our Master email column if they're not verified then we'll use find work email to kind of boost the list to find even more and then we'll go into the master email column over here and then we're just cleaning the company names right here super super easy um you know nothing crazy over here the first way that this whole uh flow is going to work is we need to find the recent LinkedIn post now I have set this so that the only way that we're looking for somebody's LinkedIn post is if Master email column is full because if I don't have an email to reach out to there's no way there's no reason that I should even be scraping their posts because I'm not even going to be reaching out to them so I used a conditional formula where I put in that you know this basically means that only run if Master email column has content in it and you'll see like I was faking one down here and so it ran on this one even though it's not an email and so we put the post date filter for 45 days ago because I didn't want it to be something crazy uh and we entered their person LinkedIn URL I don't need any of the keywords for this one and so then we let it rip for this campaign to work I need three posts to exist for the person the reason being is because if I want to create the Serendipity for this one I don't want to rerun this clay table and get new posts and then work with that workflow so what I'm actually doing is when I say saw one of your recent LinkedIn posts this is actually about their second most recent LinkedIn post and then when we talk about the LA the number of days that they posted before that that is from their second LinkedIn post to their third LinkedIn post which again all of this is 100 managed inside of clay so what we did is I set up this column where I used Ai and I was literally saying you know is number of posts three or greater true or false because that's all I need to be able to know if it's true then the rest of the workflow is going to continue to work so the way I got these post dates is I just went into the post and I went to post date I know this is one here but this is post two because zero is actually one and I just mapped this uh date here I hit add as column and then I went and I mapped this one and I hit it as column and then we have it here then for a number of days very simply I just said how many days apart are these days post date uh post to date and post three date super super easy we could spot check this is five days this is six to six days this is two days awesome so this formula is working correctly as well so now again I have achieved the second part right here the you know posted was number of days before that right now we're going to generate this message and so the way I'm generating this message is I'm using just one message when I converse with chat TPT and I'm saying using the input complete my sentence by summarizing what the LinkedIn post is about this is my input and then we're giving it the LinkedIn post keep the output under eight words and use specific keywords from the input complete the output with my prefix this is my prefix saw one of your LinkedIn posts about blah blah blah and then for the conditional run on the conditional run it is ran where I only want it to run if new column contains true and uh the post is more than 40 characters because if the post is less than 40 characters it might start you know making stuff up about how it's like not enough content and stuff so we want it to be more than 40 characters so we'll do that and now it's only going to run if these things are true we only had three people who had more than three posts so we only have three outputs so this is working perfectly again um then we used a formula to create this line as well so it seems like the last time you posted was number of days before that though and so if we go in here seems like the last time you posted was five days before that though we're just inserting it very nice and easy again we just use the AI to put this in concatenate seems like last time you posted was and then end quotes and and then the number of days and and then quotes days before that though again super super simple clay takes care of all this coding with their their AI over here so now we have achieved this sentence and now we need to achieve this sentence I just saw your post about AI generation and then we do that here and so I just saw your post about butterscotch atmosphere filtering Shields okay great these these examples are Architects that's why it's a little odd and so we for this prompt we said using the input complete a sentence summarizing what the LinkedIn post is about all of these things except we change the prefix to I just saw your post about then again we want to make sure that the the post length is over 40 characters and I'm even seeing a mistake here were actually I want so that was post see how that was post um one we actually want post zero so we'll go to posts and then see how we have this is zero and then we'll put that there so then now this is conditionally running off of Post zero will generate this formula I actually probably could have just edited it right here but it's fine cool cool cool cool awesome output is correct okay great and then we're just gonna hover over this to make sure yep see how it's find recent linked to post for user post zero post that just means it's the most recent post that we found so then we actually can just save and we don't need to run this that's just a little change so now we've created we've created this uh sentence right so I just saw your post about uh butterscotch atmosphere filter about outbound sales guide it reminded me to follow up and see if you saw this super easy now we've achieved that now what we're gonna do is we're gonna complete the third email where we give them creative ideas about things to post about right and so what we're gonna do is we need to know what their company is so I set up this enriched company which in the output of enrich company we get this description here and we know more about this company without having to scrape their website and hope that they filled out their website well and all these different things and so then um this has a conditional run on it where it only runs I guess this is actually only running yeah this is only running if there's content over here which makes sense because if there's content over here then we're going to continue with the flow if there's not content over here then we can't email them anyway and so now to give them creative ideas here's the prompt that I gave them uh you are an assistant helping me come up with three LinkedIn post ideas given information about what the company does you're very creative and can think of LinkedIn posts that will help someone get customers and so then I wrote The Prompt using the input create three bullet points of ideas for a company to post about on LinkedIn this is the input keep the output under 15 words and use specific keywords from the input to come up with ideas for a company to get more customers for social media content keep the ideas professional and output them in bullet point format um actually I gotta change this number format okay great and so now I copied and pasted this exact prompt and then I brought it down into the examples and for the example instead of having the token for description I gave it an example so I did this for Apollo and I wrote some post examples just so that I can train gpt4 to be like hey this is what I want you to say don't say anything crazy or I guess I'm doing 3.5 um don't say anything crazy I want you to say these things and we just give it examples of like what do I want this to look like I could add another example if I wanted but this is enough for the settings again I wanted to make sure that the description was over 50 characters just so that if somebody doesn't have a description or it's too short it won't just like start hallucinating and making things up so we can jump in about this and see how for you know Madam Architects which uh uh is a female-led Architecture Firm um we gave them ideas to post about inspiring stories of women in architecture for women's History Month highlight architects of uh on Madame architect that can help young women starting a career in architecture oh highlight articles webs share information about Madame architect to help raise awareness of women's contribution to the field of architecture all good LinkedIn post ideas right and so then um now we have filled out email number three so the next thing I actually over engineered this I completely forgot that enrich company has the LinkedIn follower account of the company and we can just check on this really quick so their follower account is 27 I think it said and we click on it and they have what do we got here it's an unclaimed page interesting oh my gosh there's so many people here whoops okay so it's an unclaimed page maybe we could go to something else but um anyway the follower account is down here um I used harmonic to get their follower account it's over engineered I'll probably fix it on the next go around but in harmonic you can get their follower count and then um this is the follower account that we get from harmonic and I wanted to normalize it so I just use an AI formula and I literally said add commas every three number places in follower account so it went from this to you know perfectly sequenced like that so it was nice and easy and then we need their follower account as well so uh if we have this data we'll grab their profile and we'll find their followers and then we'll throw it in there so that we can complete this sentence this email so we need the number of followers and we need these number of followers I could even add artificial intelligence to like round these numbers to like the nearest spot so that I can say about just in case the scraped data isn't totally correct but um yeah so now the only thing left to do would be to send all of these leads to a campaign the biggest thing I would tell everybody is you gotta set up your run settings so that what I do is I set up my run settings so that it only runs if everything that I need about the um the lead is completely filled out so I would come in here and I would use Ai and I would say only run if and then we need like Master email column which that won't it won't work without that but I'll be like only run a master email column is not empty and and then we need like content right so then we need like you know like and new column contains true because remember we did that and uh if you know we'll just give it like everything right like this content is not empty and you know like then like number of followers is not empty and I would just keep going right so that would be the the other thing and so uh if you enjoyed this video I'll be producing two other videos about doing the same thing for a marketing agency and doing this for clay itself as well I hope this gives you a good idea about what's possible uh when you're using clay because it can get really deep and it's really not that complicated you just need to know how to like where the Integrations are and how these formulas work and then you can you know automate these sequences that look like a human wrote them so yeah if you have any questions join uh our slack Community or you can just reach out to me on LinkedIn just Eric noislowski and I'll be happy to answer your questions\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# DIY Clay Challenge

so if any of you are like me you want to get your hands dirty I have set up this little challenge that we're going to do inside of clay that if you want to learn how to use clay this is a really easy way to be able to uh get your hands dirty and find some data so this is the uh spreadsheet it's literally called clay challenge one um all you have to do is make a copy of it or just download it do not request access from me just download it so we're going to download this comma separated list and then we're going to bring it over to Clay and we're going to start our challenge so we're going to import the data and here we go so hit continue new blank table complete the import and so the challenge that we're going to do is we want to validate if these people's email addresses are legit and then we want to find what technology these companies are using basically we want to check are these companies using using HubSpot and then we are only going to send an email to somebody if their company is between one to 50 employees and we're going to do that with a formula so step one like I said clean up these email addresses see if they're valid and then we're going to enrich them for more email addresses then we're going to find which companies are using HubSpot and then we'll send an email only to the companies that are um one to 10 No 1 to 1550 whatever 1 to 50 employees maybe I'll change it by the end but we'll see so step number one we need to clean these emails up so we're going to go to enrich data and what we could do is we could just click on emails here and then there's validate email provider so if we were to just put validate or we went to the emails see how we have all these validation providers so we can choose any of these we're going to just use debounce so we use debounce you can use your own API key or use clays for this example we going to use Clays and I need to map the email so where are those emails ah yes email is right here so we want to only uh get safe to send emails um and do we want to exclude free emails yes so we're going to say only safe send to send emails and exclude free emails see how this one is like a Gmail email address right there which the way that they are this is probably the email address that they actually use for business but I don't like emailing Gmail accounts see how it's America photog gmail.com this is probably what they use because they're like a producer and so this is probably their legitimate email address but I don't like emailing free emails so we're not going to do it so we're just going to validate all of these we're going to hit save and run those rows and then we're going to get an answer back on all of these and so see see how what it says is first possible valid email so we're going to add that as a column and we're going to hit create so now see how it says one valid so valid email EMS this one is safe to send first possible valid email now we know okay these emails are safe to send to the rest are not safe to send to which is perfect so now we're going to set up our waterfall so we're just going to add our enrichment we're going to hit work email so now we're going to set up our waterfall so that if they if we didn't get an email address from our sheet that is valid we're going to try to find more email addresses so we're going to hit full name a little bit of snafu um you need full name I guess to be in one um column so we're just going to use a formula really quick to put this together so I'm going to say concatenate first name and and then we got to put a space in between it so we put quote like space so it knows and last name because if you just if you did this without the space it would literally just be e r i c n o la aw and like it wouldn't have a space in between so you just have to do that hit generate form formula so now we went from Jeremy emmerman to our full output over here which is exactly what we want to do and now we're going to set this up again so if we have an email here we don't want to run our email enrichment column but if we don't we do want to run our email enrichment so we'll hit work email we're going to map the full name we just used and then we're going to use the company name from the we I mean the company domain from the website and we're going to drop down we'll hit run settings and so now we're going to use Ai and I'm going to say run if first possible valid email is empty right keep in mind if there's no data inside of it if it's empty that's when we want all of this to run so we'll hit generate formula output is correct and then we've selected debounce as our email validation provider again so even if prosio gives us an email we'll have debounce to verify it let's save and run first 10 rows and now it automatically added everything so see how here we have the email address and it doesn't even run on prospo it's like nope we already found the email address we're good we don't need anything so now while all this is editing another quick tip is that um the validated work email this is technically a merge column and so if we were to jump in and we were to edit it this is like I said this is the way that a merge column works we could add uh this first possible email as well as an put oh I guess we can't I guess we're going to have to well we'll merge them ourselves so what's going on here is that this domain has to be a uh catchall domain and so what we mean by that is that um aroint labs.com if you validate it there's no way to validate it and like I wrote a whole blog on this it's going to be included in the course that um what a catchall domain is essentially there's no way to validate a catchall domain all of these providers though are saying yeah this is a the catchall domain so it kept running because debounce would validate it and it would be catchall so then it would go to the next one but because all of them got it that's why we got this over here and so now we've set up our email enrichment and so now we are good to go so we're going to actually we're going to let this run on we're going to let this run on everything now so that we can complete all 25 rows so now what do we want to do we want to find who's using HubSpot now let's keep in mind though if we want to find who's using HubSpot we have to use builtwith right because people install HubSpot on their website sometimes they put it in their job descriptions and don't put it on their website but for this challenge we're just going to do the company domain builtwith costs us two credits every time we run this so what think to yourself like what do we need to do here to to check right so we're going to put HubSpot as the keyword but what else should we do if we want to save money we also want to put the Run settings so that it'll only run if first possible valid email has data or if the validated work email over here behind this has data because if we don't have their email address I'm not going to be emailing them anyway so why would I waste money on this so I'm going to put use Ai and I'm going to say run if and then we're going to go to First validated possible email is not empty or if validated work email is not empty so now we don't waste any money on enrichments that we're not going to email anyway so we'll hit output is correct save formula and then we'll continue to add Fields um I'll put the Technologies found here that's fine and so now see how it only runs when we have the the email addresses um really quick what we're also going to do is I want to make like a master email column because we have the validated work email over here and we have it over there so just real quick we'll use merge columns which literally if I just map first possible valid email and then I map the validated work email then whichever one is in there is just just going to get merged into here and this will kind of be like our Master email column right so now we have the full list of all the emails that we have so then we'll run this on everything and so now we’re prepared to write a formula where so I'm not actually going to send this email to any um sending platform because I don't have a campaign set up for these we're just going to use a formula to just pretend and so I I just want to run through everything one more time because I know I speak fast and I go really fast so I'm going to give one more overview of what we did why we did it and everything so first what we did is we uploaded this CSV right so this is the challenge this is what you need to be working off of if these people all leave their jobs and this doesn't become possible reach out to me and I'll change them you know it doesn't matter so then what we also have here so I mean no we uploaded all of this data right and so we have the email address from the data we need to find more we need to clean this email and we need to see who's using HubSpot and so first we use debounce you can use debounce zero bounce whatever you want just like pick an email validation provider in my opinion they're all basically the same um so you're going to run your integration here and then we found out which ones were clean already and then we moved on and we said okay now I want as many email addresses as I could possibly get these ones we got from Apollo we want to see what else can we get so we take the first possible valid email and we're like okay we don’t want to find any more email addresses for these people so when we set up our waterfall we said hey if there’s an email address here don’t run because we already have the data which is why it’s not even run here um on our data providers then the waterfall of all the data providers got used and then we have the validated work email over here so now to see who’s using HubSpot though we have our lookup techn technology with built with we put in HubSpot but in order to not waste any money we only ran it if there was Data inside a validated work email and if there is data inside a first possible valid email um we could have just created the master email column first and then just said like only run if there’s data inside of Master email column but you know you could just do it whichever way you want so now we have Technologies found HubSpot HubSpot messages and these are the only two so when you integrate this with lemlin uh smart lead instantly you’re going to have to run a conditional formula and so I’m not going to choose an account I’m not going to pick a campaign um you’re basically going to set this up in order to map everything right and so we would map the master email column we would map their first name we would map their last name and then we would map all of our customizations our custom variables all of those things the only reason though we want this campaign to run is only if they have HubSpot a valid email and I guess their name right so what we would do is we would use a conditional formula here and we would say hey only run if first name is not empty and master email column whoops is not empty oops and then we go into here Technologies found contain s HubSpot we could also do is not empty as well because we filtered for HubSpot but we could put is not empty and so I’m just going to copy and paste this so if we were actually adding this to a campaign we’d be able to generate this formula and we would be good because we’re not adding it to a campaign and this is just pretend we’re going to say we’re going to run a formula and so I’m going to say I’m going to copy and paste and I’m going to say output send if Matt first name is not empty Master email column is not empty and Technologies found is not empty output no send whoops no send for everything else we’ll hit generate formula great and so now this person has a first name they have a master email column they have Technologies send right so we’ll hit output is correct save formula so see how this person has Technologies we would hit send and so now this should be a pretty easy workflow for you to do for your first time in order to just mess around with the platform and you know get familiar with conditional formulas it should end with uh and you can check to make sure that you did everything correctly because if you filter this by the same criteria and you say first name is not empty and master email column is not empty and Technologies found is not empty you should only get get the results that say send over here which is a way that you can check that you did it correctly so um Yep this is challenge number one like I said I like to get my hands dirty when I'm using tools I think this is a great way to you know use just a tiny like 25 sample set in order to find these people um make a copy of the sheet download it well I guess you don’t need to make a copy you could just hit file download upload it into clay great first challenge for you to you know work your way around clay and do things that you’re going to do all the time I think the most basic thing that we do all the time is validating an email from whatever Source we got it from enriching it for more email addresses doing like one or two enrichments and then sending off of that so there you go clay challenge number one\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# End to End Local Business Prospecting Outbound Cold Email Campaign

all right everyone this is a video that people ask me about all the time this is our local business prospecting workflow video and so uh basically uh I explained this in the tools video but if you didn't get a chance to watch this video when you're prospecting local businesses like gyms HVAC companies Pest Control businesses plumbers the problem you're going to run into is they don't often have LinkedIn profiles now if you are trying to Target tech companies and they don't have a LinkedIn profile you don't even need to reach out to them because they're not doing well enough to to uh you know reach out to anyway but these plumbers they don't care about LinkedIn at all so then we have to think about what kind of profiles do they have and how can we use that to our advantage so any plumber any garage door company any restaurant any gym worth their salt has a Google Maps uh business page and so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be scraping Google Maps in this workflow I'm going to scrape Google Maps all within clay there's a couple of other tools that could get this done for you D7 lead finder outcraze clay in this scenario just keep in mind that you could also use the other ones and then import that data as a CSV and then continue the workflow going from there but we're going to use clay to end end to end on this one and so our search query we're going to do um let's do garage door repair and then in Nashville now we're going to come up for to our location query and we're going to put Nashville Tennessee and so the reason why I use like the other tools D7 lead finder and outs scraper and things like that is because in clay I can only pull one search in at a time and for me it's just easier to get a bulk list and and just get it all done in one shot um whoops I didn't mean to click on that uh but again you could do the whole thing in clay because essentially those tools are just giving us a huge list of websites which for our workflow I just really care about the websites I don't really care about anything else so then we'll add that to a new blank table and we'll let this run so we're going to name this uh garage door repare local business workflow and it's searching for businesses over here and we see how we're getting 54 rows soon we'll have like 60 I'm going to call the number maybe like 606 67 we'll see uh you have this business found for you over here and so we just can click on that we can see the data tipt garage doors Nashville awesome so we're going to map that into the name right there you got their phone number and then we've got their Google rating oh my gosh we've got their Google rating and then we have their website which this is basically all of the data that's important to us I'll take the reviews too um it's amazing like sometimes we have private Equity clients and like everybody cares about reviews it's like so funny um all right so I'll move the reviews over here so now what we need to essentially do is we need to bifurcate uh we need to split this uh list into people that we can find owners LinkedIn email addresses for and Linkedin profiles for and people that we can't the reason being is if we can find the owner of these businesses amazing that's exactly what we're going to be reaching out with but if we can't then we have to use other methods to try to find it so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to click add enrichment and we're going to click find contacts at company and we'll hit company identifier and we'll put the website in as the company identifier and now we'll put in all of our keywords around being an owner president founder owner honestly that's all I can think of right now so we also I want to put it in the United States just cuz sometimes people in other countries will just fake that they're the CEO of this company it's just messes things up so I just put United States on there as well now a big thing you want to keep the limit um you do not want to limit this to one even though we're looking for one person the big reason you don't want to limit this to one is because if we find more than one person we know that this company is a franchise and you need to handle it slightly slightly differently so we'll hit continue to add Fields let's just let this run okay great company not found which this is going to be totally normal see now this is probably a franchise and so if we jump into this right Dependable garage door owners why are there so many owners hold on let's take let's take a peek here vice president oh yeah so this this company is a lot larger and they know what they're doing here so we're going to exclude Vice I forgot about that she'll save that and run it again cool no profile found still 10 what are they doing over here president and CEO Garage Door Tech and restaurant owner for them president owner interesting so this one it this we might just see see this is so odd that it's coming this is irishman's overhead their experience Overhead Door Corporation interesting so this this is a franchise so we we just know that now um and so we'll let this run and so basically what we'll do is let's find one that's actually normal which you know out of 54 who knows oh here we go here we go see how like this this is going to be your hit rate like a lot of these people they're not going to have so see how this is uh Door Systems where is this person classic Doors Inc let's find this person Jerry Suzanne Miller CEO classic Doors Inc that's what we want so now now we're just going to take let's see I want first name which is so funny in the mapping it's like below yeah it's so funny okay so we want first name and this is so funny I bet sometimes business owners do this like this is like an old thing business owners used to do see how is a Jerry Suzanne Miller I do not believe for a second that this is this person's name I think this is the husband and wife pair and it's Jerry Miller and Susan Miller and um they're just sharing a LinkedIn profile which is like sorry that's so Boomer like that's they used to do that all the time all right cool and so we've got this mapped out and it's we don't really have a whole lot of great people here oh we we don't want just the first name we want the last name too I got a little little lost with the Boomers and the way they make their LinkedIn profiles cool all right map this in okay cool and so the first workflow that we're going to set up is we want to try to find the email addresses of everyone at these companies if we can and so we're going to take out our old prosio workflow here oh I gotta I gotta concatenate everything we'll save these changes um I got to turn this into well actually I don't have to turn this into a full name what I'm just going to do is I'm just going to map the name up here and then we'll just use that uh if you're new to Clay I could have done two things one I could have mapped it so it's easy for me to just pick it out right here or two I could have clicked on this clicked on people clicked on the zero and then hit name right here it's all going to be the same exact thing so then company domain we're going to map the company domain we got from Google Maps we'll include catchalls cuz I trust them and then we'll run it and now we're going to try to find all these people's email addresses once we get their email addresses whoops and we're going to run this as well once we get these people's email addresses now we will have a column see okay now we got this person's email address amazing let's add this as uh founder email is what we want to call this so now we have a Founder email address and we're going to move to the side now what we're going to do is we just because we didn't find an email address for them doesn't mean it's gone forever so we're going to use scrape website to try to find email addresses of these people so we'll go to Output fields and then we're going to hit emails and now the Run settings is we only want this to run if so I'm going to use the AI so everyone watching this video can use it run if founder email is empty right because if the founder email is empty we want to run this to find the generic email address right so then we're going to run those columns continue to add Fields save and run in this situation again I'm using prosio just set up here um another probably email address finder that I would suggest using along with prospo might be drop contact because drop contact also tells you drop contact can take a person's LinkedIn profile profile as the input and then you can try to find the email address that way and so um they're they're just another another good one and so now we'll just click on these and we'll see oh great oh shoot I just clicked the mail to link so now we have Jennifer and we've got Connie at DD hd.com and so we're going to just stick with the first one because we don't want anything to be crazy and so prospo email addresses are already validated we need to validate these email addresses um little bit of a like these work right is um see how see how we got this in here and we got like ymail.com and some of this garbage in here the way scrape website is finding its email addresses is called a regular expression and so when you're looking at these email addresses it's always word at word and then Dot and so there's a regular expression scraping this to try to find uh these things so I don't know know why that one showed up but sometimes you'll get terrible emails showing up in here so like they put your email.com on their website here which like I don't know why they would do that but you know more power to you and so all we want to make sure that we do and I'm just trying like youd domain.com oh this is from Home Depot whoops all we want to do to just make sure that we're good here and we can actually email these is we want to bring in our debounce integration so we'll just hit debounce we're going to validate these emails and so we're going to hit zero and we're only going to map safe to send email addresses so that now we won't accidentally throw this into our sequencing tool or throw this into our sequencing tool because it's not going to validate and it's not going to be a legit email address like this one it looks like it's probably a legit email address right so now we have our first save to to send email address now this this video I mean it's going to be pretty in-depth and I would be uh sad if I didn't show you kind of the next um The Next Step that we have here so what I like to do and this is this is being nitpicky but I think it if you reach out to somebody and you don't have their first name versus having their first name it is a completely different game and so what we do is we use AI to pick out their um their name from the email address so I'll say using the input try to tell me if uh tell me what the person's first name is the input is just an email address do not output a first name unless you are over 97% confident that that is their first name this is the input because a lot of times we'll get their email address and it's kind of dumb to be like hey there and then their email address is John at garage door company it's like okay great that would have been super easy this is the input and then we'll get the validated first safe to send emails and now we have to train this data right I'm big big big on training this data so we'll go and we'll hit add example and then we will look at some of these so one di right so what's up di see how this is di super easy take this one add example boom and I'm just going to map that in and I'm going to bring this and hit this and do that all store door live um H if you do H let's put this before confident that that is their first name if you do not have if you don't know the name or you are less than 97% confident output nothing so now we have to train it and so we're going to say I'm going to take all this I'm going to replace this cuz we changed it boom boom boom all right so now we're just going to Output nothing and now let's go down here and let's pick a tough one so this is a good one because this th this is such a good one I'm glad we found this one so this is a good one because we don't want AI to get messed up on on L Kennedy here see how see how it's l Kennedy Kennedy could be somebody's first name but I want it to know that that L is going to screw us up here so now if we reach out to them and we say Kennedy is that the end of the world no but you know I I just I just want to give it that example this AI stuff is all about training it on the proper the proper data so now I'm going to say what did I do here oh yeah Luke so now we're going to train it to say Luke so it's not going to be an idiot and be like 1711 we will go the cheap route on this one no need to have gp4 on this uh only oh whoops keep thinking sometimes that's the AI so now we'll get first safe to send email is not empty generate that and now let it run find extra owner's first name okay cool we'll let it run on everything I know this prompt is going to work I mean no I'm saying this for the video and I might have to go back and fix it who knows uh while this is running I'm a big fan of um the show Survivor if anyone's ever seen Survivor see that's what I mean so I said I was like super confident that this is going to work and uh it it didn't it didn't work so what I was going to say in surv is in the show Survivor like they vote people out and every time somebody's like I'm super confident they get voted out and that's just like what happened to me okay so this okay how are you anable I trained you on this data all right so I guess we are going to try to switch to gp4 you know what and let's let's actually tell it to Output nothing so that it's not just going to make up something and let's try switching it to gp4 geez that's too funny yep so we couldn't have the C student do the work so we had to bring in the way overpaid Harvard MBA to to get it done but that's totally fine come on get Diana come on you overpaid Harvard MBA yeah okay great so we'll um we'll run this on all of them that haven't run okay so now we have more um names right so now what we want to do is I just want to have a formula so that we have all of the names together in one shot because now this is where the the split is going to happen right so um bring let's see first name to this column if first name is not empty is not empty or and I'm going to put this on or if first name is empty and response does not con contain nothing bring response here so we'll put response to this column great Genera a formula amazing okay Splash a Red Bull so now we're going to get all of the owner's names here so we got di Kyle Luke Jesse Jerry Susan love it near th hang okay great so now we're going to say like uh Master owner first name so I don't have to reference them back and forth so now what we need to do is we basically are going to get like so now you either basically we could do one more formula here where we could say you know hey there if Master owner first name is empty output hey there or if Master owner first name is not empty concatenate hello let's put howdy we're doing a video howdy and master oner first name great howdy love it okay great so now we have all these people's email addresses and so we have our salutation here now this is where you have to decide where you're going with your campaign this is kind of out of scope for this video but um now what I would do is if you have the person's first name that means that you you can write like an AI line based off of the information you got from their website you can you can basically do a whole lot of things in here and so what I would suggest is if you have their LinkedIn URL you write an AI line based on their their LinkedIn URL if you don't have their LinkedIn URL you could say hey I saw I checked you out like all this other stuff um if one of my favorite ways to open up these local business prospecting videos is like these local businesses they don't want to admit it but nobody ever answers the phone I bet I could call one of these people and like they're not going to answer the phone see I mean craziness like it's like they don't answer the phone so what I like to say in the email and like I know there's a lot of people who are like um you know you don't want to lie in emails and I totally get that so you got to find out where your line is um if you don't want to lie in the email I would say hey I saw the phone number on the website was 615 696 73000 um give I like I saw that but I you know found your email address and I figured email would be easier um you know I was looking around for garage door companies in Nashville and I saw you guys have a 4.9 star rating over 230 reviews and then you could like because what you're trying to do is these businesses get spam emails all the time like you think like Tech Founders think they get spam emails these people get the worst emails ever because their their emails are so public on their website that they're getting completely garbage emails uh all day long so all you need to do is just need you need to write a message that's better than than what they are used to getting and so if you put their phone number in the Outreach you put their Google reviews in the Outreach and everything and you know all that like you're going to get a really good message across the other thing that you can do and this doesn't work for everybody but I like doing this too is if we pull in the Yelp information so uh we're going to pull in this Yelp oh no I don't want to do that hold on yeah we're going to find reviews so the place ID I don't have the place ID I guess we got to find this business so we'll do everybody here is in Nashville right and so I'm this is getting kind of out of scope for this video what I would do is I would like see how it's 531 varas Street Nashville Tennessee I would clean this so it's just Nashville Tennessee and then put this location in but then our search query is literally going to be their business name so we should nail it and so I'm going to limit it to just one I don't want to include the ad results and so then we only want to run this I guess we're going to run it for everyone well I guess you like really you only want to run this if we have an email address to send to um so like I should have merged the email addresses into one or we could just do this and say um founder email or first safe to send email is is not empty right so that we're not wasting credits on running this so now we go out we find the businesses yeah of course it's missing the input this is like so funny so we'll go find these businesses and this is just another thing that we can add on top of it and I know the video is running a little bit long so now we got this one business found right we got this business we got their rating and now see how this is their their review this snippet this is what I'm searching for here where now we can say like oh I saw how the customer we can use AI to be like uh like and I could and now we could say like oh like you know you were extremely great to this customer who you helped to troubleshoot things over the phone and so yeah that's uh and then I think so if we have the place ID here though I think we could get even more data it just gets a little bit expensive at this point uh I just want to show you though like the the best and greatest things we could do so find business info and then we have their name wait no what we were just doing this find businesses find business info find reviews sorry sorry sorry so this is the place ID we got find businesses right and then we'll go to businesses zero and then we're going to hit Place IDs and we're going to hit that one looks right and then maybe we want to see something in the review sort reviews by highest rated and I just want one review we're we're good to go with that hit that so we could look for keywords in there we could look for people who are like your parking lot is small and like stuff like that uh but here we go and so we got one review over there but here's how we can get a full review cool see user we got Patrick and Patrick comment was call John after my garage door was raised I got admit No Other Plumber electric has ever taken the time to me fix problem he told me that I just saved myself 250 I highly recommend blah blah blah this is great so now you could reach out to them and you could be like hey you know this was awesome uh I saw this review about your person and it was like so awesome to see that another way you can get this done I know I keep just adding on to this video is uh clay has this cayan feature which so now to do this this was like one credit or one of these was two credits so that was one credit and this is one credit okay so we're looking at two credits depending on what plan you're on clent might be able to be cheaper for you on this and so you could say find me the reviews of this company on either Google or Yelp I want to find a review of a happy customer this is the website and then what we can do is we can like map the website in here and then we we can make sure we're using 3.5 so it doesn't get crazy and then Max cost so depending on what clay plan you're on this could cost like three like a penny to like five cents to run so we could keep it under our normal cost and we could hit oh shoot uh well I would I would have to run make a run setting so that it only ran when it was relevant so probably like the same run setting we have over here whoops and so no it's going off into the world our little Harvard MBA and so then we've got this running we've got these running and so if it's cheaper for you you might be able to use clent to just find the reviews and then you still have to use AI to like write a line about those re reviews so we look at this A happy customer review from corner I found a positive they review mentioned that the customer had a great experience oh and I could probably change this and I could say um bring me back what the customer said and if you can their first name as well and we could just run this again so then we could hit this we could hit this and so clent could do this work for you as well and maybe it would be cheaper than than using the the clay credits to get it done and so now anyway like I said to conclude this video wow 30 minute video that's crazy to conclude this video it's all about how you want to take the direction of the campaign uh I've done this where I've targeted restaurants in the past and we basically the messaging we would say is um hey I saw that you know customers could call this number but I figured email would be easier for you at this point um and then we' just like get into our pitch and then I would basically then I used um their address to I got into the pitch we said something about the pitch and then I deleted everything like I normalized it so we just had this name I used AI to just be like Bell Forest Circle or old murf rebor Pike building and so then I would put this in and I would say oh I looked you up on Google Maps and do you guys get a lot of foot traffic being on Old muffer Pike uh building or do you get a lot of foot traffic Beyond Old Hickory Boulevard I couldn't tell you know like we would say something like that so with these local businesses you just need to hammer them with um with more information please visit the yel plank basic your user us found reviews interesting see this wasn't maybe that helpful so I guess you'd stick with this but anyway um what the way we've done this in the past as well is like we reached out to Pest Control businesses and we wanted to see if they wanted to sell their business so if we knew if we found their LinkedIn profile I'd be like oh looks like you've been running this company since blah blah blah like would you want to sell it and then if we didn't find their LinkedIn profile we'd do pretty much the same thing like uh Hey like you know I see that customers could call you at this phone number um but I figured email would be easier I was really interested in your company because I'm trying to buy Pest Control companies in Nashville I saw you guys have a 4.9 n star rating across you know 230 reviews would you be dop in to sell blah blah blah blah blah we'd get into it um HVAC HVAC I did that back when I worked at another company before I ran my own company and we would just basically reach out to them and we'd say you know uh hey I uh I saw like we scraped their website and then we would use AI to basically be like considering this website how does this company get a like how does this company differentiate themselves against like normal HVAC companies and so then we would say you know looking at your website I could see that you guys take like the way that you stand out in the crowd of HVAC companies is you you know uh like you have a huge care about service is that how you get a leg up and then we used Yelp to find the competitor in the area because you can use fine businesses let see how we only found one business found so if we were to just search for their their like name and address well if we were to take out their address and make it like this and we just wanted Nashville so if we just put Nashville here and then we put the search query let me just show you so if we put Nashville here the the reason I didn't do this in the main video is because then if you pull in garage door companies from San Francisco this part is going to break but for now we'll just keep it like this so if we put the limit as three right what what's going to happen is we're going to get more businesses um no business business found three businesses found right so this company this company's Brentwood garage door services right and so number one is Brentwood garage door services number two is all four seasons garage doors Nashville this is their competitor so we would then use this information to reach out to them and say oh hey like you know I saw on your website that you guys take a lot of care of your customers um and I'm I bet this is how you stand out in the the area um when when people are deciding between calling you and all four seasons garage doors Nashville uh you know how are they usually making that decision we've got a workshop about branding coming up that's basically what we did and so uh yeah like this is how you again the scope of this video is basically how do you get the first names of the owners and then what do you do if you don't have the first names of the owners and then you could split from there um how you take your pitch is kind of like an open source from there and these are kind of some of the ideas that we ran in the past I hope this was useful to you and uh keep on watching those videos\#\# Date Posted: 2024-06-01

\# Steal These Cold Email Copywriting Templates

hey everyone if you haven't noticed I'm in a uh season of thinking about how we can make it unreasonable to get responses for our customers and so this evening I worked on a swipe file that uh I'll probably be posting on social media but I'm probably you could just read it here um of a bunch of templates that you can just start off using for cold email and you could just start inputting how you help people so that you don't have to think about the structure of the email as much and you can just be testing value propositions because good copyrighting sometimes just comes down to like a good structure and the way that you think about things and um the reason why people respond though is all about the offer so we're just going to jump into it I'm just going to walk you through the dock pretty simple uh video today so the first DOC the first sequence that we have in here is uh our like standard email sequence now what I would say is I've already made a dedicated video on this so I'm not going to go too deep into it but this is still one of my favorite email templates that I've ever created mostly because it modulates no matter what offer you have everything modulates in the The Campaign so if you've never seen this before we have our first line which is a recency waterfall or a relevance-based first line so what I mean by this is like I've used I've used clay.com to create a workflow where we look for something recent about the person and then if we can find anything recent we say hey like I saw your LinkedIn post about blah blah blah started checking out your company and how you help people do blah blah blah and I thought we should be connected or we could say something more relevant where we say something like hey you know I could tell that the sales team is growing because on LinkedIn Jennifer seems like she joined the team four months ago right and so we just switch between either one of those things and then here we just insert the messaging to be tested so this is where you you know you've got your value propositions and you've got your your big value proposition and you've got your micro little value propositions as well and you want to be testing as many of them in here keep thinking about how do you help people save time how do you help them save money how do you help them make more money those kinds of offers then we say specifically I think it could help you and then we just train AI on what the uh company does that we're doing the Outreach for and then we show the AI what the prospects company does so then we can say like um you know if we were reaching out it would be like you know I think we specifically I think uh we could help you you know automate your outbound to doctors so that you guys would be able to help more of them make more money what like whatever it would come out to be and then we'd say if we could help you you know with your outbound marketing would that be useful to you nice nice and easy one one line and I'm just gonna I'm just gonna say this right now one line that I'm percolating on right now I was just watching an Alex Heros video and um an alternative that I just got hit with uh that he said was basically um is there any amount of proof and send that would make it worth take a call with me and so basically this he didn't even mean it in a copyrighting frame but he meant it in a totally other frame of just basically saying what would it take to be able to change your mind about this thing and that started getting me thinking about ctas uh as well so anyway I was just thinking about that AI generated analogy all this is is we basically train AI on how our company or the company were doing Outreach for helps people save time save money or make more money then we look at their company description and then we ask AI like what's the most obvious thing that they do help people save time save money or whatever and then make an analogy from that so it' be like hey Jim shark the same way you guys help people save money on fashionable fitness clothing we help people save money by scaling their outbound without uh hiring people right so that's what it would look like so then email 2 hey first name and I have to imagine you didn't leave past company Stoke to worry about problem see just like a slight personalization nothing nothing crazy and then we just have our messaging to be tested no need to hop on a call could I send you a video of how it works the reason why we're switching to a video now is because they didn't respond to like a you know a CTA for you know interest where I'm really going for a call so now we're seeing like hey can I send you something that's asynchronous and that's not going to take up your time and we'll see how it goes then we've got this PS I actually learned this from Andy muor and I thought it was just really great I really liked it uh he was putting in his emails PS or feel feel free to tell me to pound sand and people really responded well to it they thought it was funny and they said oh you know I wasn't going to respond until I saw your Ps and I thought it was funny and you know it's fine and some people would tell you to pound sand but they're going to tell you to unsubscribe anyway so who cares and so uh then we get into here hey first name let me know if and then we'll just call out another person or two at the company that potentially handles this as well with a similar title so if we reaching out to marketing leaders and this so happens to be the director of marketing we'll try to find the chief marketing officer or the the VP of marketing and then this is just um this is actually one of my most popular videos on YouTube it is also one of the more popular campaigns that we run the only reason I buried it in email 3 is just because I really want the value propositions to speak for themselves because this this is really we're testing for Value propositions and then here it might come up with a value proposition that we didn't intend and we can get those learnings right so I put this in here essentially if you've never seen that video before all we're doing is we're just using AI to again the same thing as up here where we're using AI to come up with how we specifically could help them but now it's giving three bullet points um instead and maybe I can make that a bit yeah let's do that and do any of these look like a fit we could discussed with your team great so we go in there and so our next template a Josh Brun style email uh this is so I think Josh Bron is just the best quote unquote influencer Guru around cold email copy and uh I just like his style a ton and so hopefully I paid homage to it uh well enough and so we just go into it uh Hey first name uh relevant first line same thing as above and then a poke the bear question um so a poke the bear question is just a question to make them think differently about the problem and your offering so he always uses this as a as an example he always says how are you preparing for your Iron Man that's just a regular question but if you instead were to say how are you training so that you don't get shin splints weeks before the Big Race now that you're you know thinking about the it's you're making them think about something they possibly haven't considered or it's a it's a big fat problem and then this is an easy way to just test your messaging we're helping companies like case study oh I got to put case stady uh achieve outcome in time frame without without no good rotten thing uh somebody asked me what this meant uh because you know this party people on the the dock somebody asked me what I meant this is just the problem so we are helping companies like one schema or numeral HQ achieve two to three leads a day uh without scaling their outbound team right that's like what we'd be able to say another one is a lead magnet email I actually think everyone should be using a lead magnet I but I am just writing these with the knowledge that most people won't have a lead magnet but I've made other videos on that should search my YouTube channel for those um I I think everyone should have a lead magnet email Alex OSI just wrote a great book called hundred million leads that you should just read everyone should have a lead magnet email but anyway it's really so the tough part about lead magnet emails and giving you a template is lead magnet emails basically write themselves when you nail it and so uh once you have your lead magnet it'll all form so I mean I said I saw something relevant about your message we help companies achieve this I'd never expect you to believe me without giving you something first I made you a resource and wonder if you let me know if it was useful and then maybe we could chat this is just a template but honestly this is like the weakest template I've probably ever come up with really the like I I just wanted this as a placeholder of you should have a lead magnet campaign strategy and so this is one that has worked amazingly well for us in the past we say hey first name saw you post pretty often on LinkedIn we're a team of B2B data scrapers and I made something for you I scraped to your past 10 posts to find everyone that engaged and I enriched them with with their work emails titles and company names here's the link to the seet just request access so they know that you got it and so that is precisely how we would um you know like that's that's just a great lead magnet email that for every 10 people we reached out to we got a positive response so killer killer email this is a style that I learned from uh Patrick William Joyce and so or pwj so shout out to him follow him on LinkedIn um I I just really like the way that he does his email so a lot of times see how we kind of have this F shape going where we have all the spacing and one sentence per line and everything he sends it to them as if you know he's a CEO just quickly texting another CEO so hey first name are there any discussions internally re thing you do we're helping companies like blah blah blah achieve blah and so you could really just switch this out for any kind of value proposition statement I'm just putting that because it's an easy way to frame value propositions so anyway um what did else that I want to say about this oh uh you might see that none of these have subject lines that's because I think subject lines there's no template for subject lines there's just framework so I don't like to I don't like to say this subject line is better than anything I mean if your subject line doesn't beat quick question then switch it right like that's not going to work but so um the way I think about subject lines is how how can you send a subject line that it's possible that a customer sent them an email or a colleague sent them an email with that subject line that's mostly the way that I think about it and so then the here goes nothing campaign I don't know I just kind of like this one it's uh uh literally subject line is here goes nothing and then I say I know I'm just a rando from LinkedIn so I'll keep it quick we're helping companies do this thing and then this is that like Alex hosi call out here I think I would if I were given an actual offer to apply this template to I might switch it up a little bit but I just like the way this subject line comes across and then this preview text comes across um it it's definitely a very casual read and so for some audiences it might not be the best like uh possibly CFOs oh I see I don't want to pigeon hole any titles into this but there are some audiences that might be a little buttoned up who who might not like the style of email if you were to email this to like a tech founder I think they would love it and uh well no I do know that they would love it we've run it in the past and um you know like VPS of sales and things like that so anyway younger crowd I would guess because this Rando part um and then an extremely short email literally shortest email you see of all day if someone could help you blah blah blah would that be useful literally right to the point now in the vein of being the shortest email of the day we also have the Orin claf special and so Orin claf he is a best-selling author he wrote not sure how many books but uh flip the script and Pitch anything were some of my favorite books that he wrote and um I went to a lot of his events I think he he's a really great presenter and I um actually I used to work for him too and so I I went to a lot of his events and one thing he would do all the time and I wouldn't say this is for everybody by any means but it's kind of a fun pattern interrupt is he puts the whole message in the subject line and says would you like to chat re and then whatever outcome and then he literally just says Hey first name whole question is in the subject line let me know if you like to connect and it's just a pattern interrupt and so he usually does this to raise money uh for companies um so it would look like would you like to chat are increasing your top of funnel pipeline we could you know probably add some more but well no uh maybe make it shorter I guess but anyway uh not for the faint of heart is basically what I want to say about that one the unique College call out now this one is really fun kudos to Yash on the uh clay team for actually inspiring ing this one and I I just thought it was it was such an interesting one so basically you you use clay to look up what college they went to and then use AI to generate a unique event that happens at that college annually and then you say three to five words about that in the subject line and then we say hey for same I figur get emails like this all the time so I want it to be quick again we're helping companies and this is just this is really just a value proposition statement any way you want to put it this is just an easy framework to think of but anyway you want to put your value proposition great and say is solving uh problem a priority over a company name recently signature and then we say notice you went to college and have heard the event is pretty popular I wanted to make a subject line that would stick out in your inbox and we'll probably keep it like that uh creative ideas campaign we already talked about that this is just as an email one and I just switched out the the content so that we could use it as an email one and then these are just generic templates to just keep you thinking right so quick outcome based email relevant first line or fallback line and so what I mean by that is like something relevant or our fallback line for everything is usually I saw how your company helps you know people do blah blah blah and I wanted to get connected if I could help you do is that something you'd be interested in right just quick just quick stuff that you could just iterate on really quick quick case study email uh I recently just held case study company accomplish outcome and I think we do something similar for you could I show you how it works again super super quick lots of different ways that you can change that company founding story this is one that I love I love to use if the company has a great founding story so for example if you founded a company to scratch your own itch and you say that to people who were just likely you so if you used to run gyms and now you run a company for gym owners and you used to own e-commerce Brands and now you run a company that helps e-commerce Brands they want to know that you're similar and so um anyway this is just to say we started company because and then you could say like I wasn't e-commerce brand and I hated collecting sales tax automatically you know whatever you wanted to say and then you just jump into it and then this is just some Frameworks to think about local business Outreach where we just personalize by the competitor uh from Google Maps this isn't anything crazy um and then feedback email so I think it's important to all like as the founder of growth engine X we are always looking to get sales conversations for our customers but sometimes we don't really know exactly what to say to them so sometimes feedback emails are great because they allow us to take some shots on goal and to test some feedback without going crazy and just you know talking to No One essentially so this is uh Jed Marley he great copywriter literally stealing this from him go follow him on LinkedIn to he literally sent this in his newsletter uh so also follow him uh from his newsletter and he's saying hey first let me preface by say I'm trying not to sell you I was hoping to get some feedback from you as someone I would normally sell to I've started to build the sales team here at M shakes and so you could say anything really you could say anything you want here about your value proposition we're a competitor of tools like blah blah blah blah I'm genuinely curious if anything what would it take for you to consider an alternative or basically I gave other options or swap out for an explanation of how you help and then swap out for do you currently have this problem right and just just try to get feedback from people because a lot of times people are more helpful than you might think um as long as you come across a little bit more genuine and then um this media template we've used I really like this media template a lot for for two different reasons one it helps get feedback but then two it also helps build a lead magnet for companies that don't have lead magnets and so what I mean by this is basically we reach out and we say we're speaking with other VPS of sales and we're curious if we could get a quote no call is necessary we just said two questions and we just say question intended to actually ask their opinion this becomes the question of like we asked 50 VPS of sales how they decrease their speed to lead and this is these were all the answers right that's the the thing that we could you know turn into a lead magnet right or we could and then number two is question intended to see if they have a problem you might be able to help solve so if we then say you know do you feel like your calendar solution is making things harder to get back to leads faster or easier it's just some question to just see you know do they actually recognize this as a problem um that's what we'll do in the second one I'm trying to think of any other examples like if we were think about clay.com like question intended to see if they have the problem it would be like the first question would be like how many data providers does your sales team have access to and then the second one would be uh does your sales how much time on average do you feel that your sales reps spend researching you know a contact in each of the databases or you could even ask how many of those databases do you feel like go to waste because it doesn't fit their normal workflow things like that right so you could ask different questions to see what people care about the most and then we just say we're looking to share answers from you and your peers anonymously in a report any response would be appreciated boom that's just basically the way we think about it then just follow-up templates with follow-up the big thing I think about with follow-ups is they didn't respond to your first email so now we just have to think about how can we just twist it slightly to you know we talked about one value proposition how do we talk about something else these are some so other than just general follow-ups here's some interesting follow-ups we've we've done in the past so we'll send memes so it's like hey first name let me know if this meme resonates at all and then we'll do something like sales reps your your team cleaning out the CRM and then your team's bandwidth or just cleaning out your CRM whatever it might be Jokes Aside let me know if You' like to connect re insert problem you solve right so let me know if you'd like to connect about CRM hygiene or whatever you want to talk about there this is another one I like some people say this is too salesy call me out I don't care um so basically a lot of times when we're writing our email one there's things that we have to cut from email one that get put into email 2 and I like to distinctly put them in a bullet point so it's like hey this is you know the quick and down dirty how we can help and then another one I like is to just say I rolled the dice reaching out to you um or other employee name let me know that this falls under you or if I should reach out to them and um yeah I just like following up but this is usually more of like my last email um in a sequence and then uh with this doc I mean I intend on sharing this with customers so with this doc I also included you know every like personalized line that I can think of that um we've made in the past so maybe we'll make a video on that but with that video I'd want to show how we make all of those so I'm just going to have to sit down and film it but uh yeah thank you for watching the video as usual I hope you guys got value\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# How Salespeople Can Use Webhooks and APIs

hey everyone in this video I'm gonna go over how to use a web hook or an API if you are a salesperson or you're on a REV Ops Team or something like that using web Hooks and apis feels like a cheat code for sales Automation and things like that because you don't have to rely on the Integrations that the tool gives you and so the first thing we're going to cover is what is the difference well I guess what is a web hook and an API right and so one I'm not technical so if anybody has a problem with this I great I I would agree with them I am very much a sales person first um but the a web hook in an API is essentially the way that you can get softwares to talk within one another they could send information they can kick off workflows they can do a lot of things but this is how two softwares communicate together and so when you're using an API you can think of it as uh you know when you get you know a new email address and you want to send that email address to your sales like engagement platform you could use an API to automatically add it straight in and so uh if you have data and you want to you know In This Moment add all of that data in you can do that uh I compare it a lot to uh if you're you know at your house and you're you know waiting for mail or you're you're sending mail really it's you're sending mail um you can just same thing with opening it like using an API is just opening up a door you open the door you put the mail in the mailbox you sent it there you wouldn't control we're in control of the timeline and everything that happened there a web Hook is different though take the same uh mail example if you were waiting for a package to come you're not opening the door every five minutes to check if the package is there you're waiting for the Amazon delivery person to ring your doorbell and then you go down and you open up the door so in one situation you're opening up the door and you're you know checking things and that's what an API would do if you're constantly checking or you're sending things or you're opening up the door to send the mail and then a web Hook is somebody coming in and ringing your doorbell and saying hey we've got something for you here so apis is kind of like sending stuff out and then web hooks is when things come in and they come in instantaneously and so in this video we're going to go over a lot of examples of how to do this we're going to start though with a web hook so I have this form Builder over here where uh we have these web hooks set up well we're going to go over how to set up a web hook and so you can go to Integrations and then you see web hooks right here and so in the web hook we're just going to click connect and then we need an endpoint URL hmm where do we get the endpoint URL well the endpoint URL comes from uh the tool that you want to send the data to and so if I come into clay this is clay.com and I set up a web hook Source I can click on the web hook whoops and then see how we have this link right here this is where we would be sending oh whoops this is where we would be sending the data to so if we hit connect great so now it's connected and now I'm going to fill this out I'm going to say Eric Noah slotsky and then immediately we're going to hit submit and the data is going to be sent to the web hook now we can delete this and we can do another one make.com is another place that you could send web hooks it's the same exact process as uh as clay he would just open it up we're going to click web hooks well actually I don't want a mail hook I want a web hook and then we're just going to click add IP restrictions we don't need anything like that we're just going to hit save and now we have this link right here so then we're going to grab this link and then we're going to put it in here we're going to hit connect and then I'm gonna put this one in again and I'm just going to hit Eric noislowski run hit submit great and then it's filled out and then see how it's doing it's looking for stuff right now so if we were to hit run this module only whoops we're gonna hit okay run this module only and maybe we need to send some data right now whoops send that data again now we've sent this data and now we have this form response and we can see the fields and we have the value here and we have the value here same way that we have the values over here and so essentially that's setting up a web hook super super easy usually not usually the tool you're sending the data to has the web hook URL you send it to that end point you're good to go now we're going to have apis and so I find apis to be more difficult to use because there's variations oftentimes in the tool and so what I mean by that is is everyone has different API documentation and so a web hook you could just wire up and you're just good to go everyone has different API documentations so you have to watch out for different things um so first we're going to go over to tagmas API and so what I love about the tagmas API as a non-technical person I don't know what all of this what I love is he's got this query parameter thing where I can create the uh search that I'm gonna do and then after I create the search that I'm going to do he changes the end point over here so if I were to delete Eric and I would delete Noah slavski see how his endpoint changes right and maybe you didn't see it but see how I added Eric and it got put in and then let's move over a little bit and then see how I add Noah slotsky and it gets added in I love that about his end point and so um yeah that's just really really great to use so now if I want to use his find email uh parameter I'm just going to come in here and I need to add an API key which then gets added where is the API uh this is the API obviously this is not my API key but then this would be the API um and so oh we're gonna actually put that there so that it's there when I can copy and paste it so what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit copy and paste on this section here and I'm going to get this endpoint URL so now we're going to open up uh the HTTP API and we're going to go over this so Mo I'm actually again I'm not in technical so I don't know but I would say most API tools basically look like this where you have the method you have the endpoint you have the body and you have the headers and then I'm not even sure what this really is then you have a rate limit which just real quick a rate limit is like if they say you can only do 10 calls for 10 seconds then you know you'd rate limit it so you're not just overloading it um so let's jump into this so the method the API docs always tell you the method if they don't tell you the method it's most likely this get method right here and so if we go to detagma see how it says get up here but then he'll also put it over here in the request as well and so this is going to be a get method and then the end point we're going to drop our endpoint right inside of here and so um we're actually going to save this and we're just going to split this up a little bit um so we're splitting this up splitting this up because he needs first name and last name um and so we just need like I said we just need this oh whoops I need it in first name and last name also now we have first name last name and so we'll come in here and now this isn't going to work because we have to like this would work for for just me but it's not mapped inside of my data so what we have to do is we have to map the data inside and so all I do is just replace the data with the data inside of my table so if we were to have 100 rows with 100 different names and 100 different domains it would all work this we're gonna put I mean here and we are good now we're gonna just have to put an API key here I'm going to pause the video to do that um and we'll just do that in a little bit now other times this is why I love to tag this API as well other times you might have body text and so we're going to go over find email and we're going to have body elements but in detachments there's no body elements so it's super easy to use but we do have this header here and so we're gonna have to put in the header and so the header uh is going to be accept application Json so I'm actually just going to copy and paste the application Json I'm going to put it in here so see how it says headers so we're going to add new key and value pair so remember it was accept and then application Json so we're just going to put that in the exact same way that they have it so see again it's accept colon application Json we don't need the colon but this is the key value pair or the key end value pair so it's accept application Json so now if we were to run this I did not give my API key so if we were to try to run this right now it would go and it's going to probably say error yeah so then we have error API ID is not valid so I'm going to pause and get my API key so I entered my API key in here and then you can see we found email addresses and this is all the outputs that we get from Detachment so we've set up our first API now Detachment when I was using apis at first datagma was probably the easiest API that I ever used so we're going to go on to something that's a little bit more complicated um which it's not I mean in the grand scheme of things it's not that complicated but if you don't know what you're looking at it's like you're just going to be completely lost so we're going to open up HTTP again and we have all this set up now we're going to go to find emails documentation so let's click on this so we are going to find somebody's email address from their name and so this is he gives us the example request over here and so we have a couple of different things here so first we have the request is a post remember how in the past we used get now we're going to switch this to post so that's the first thing that we're going to do now we need our end point so we go here and we say okay this is my end point so I'm going to copy and paste this you don't need the quotes don't take the quotes so then we copy and paste the endpoint so it knows where it's going now here we have a body that we need to worry about so in clay we do the headers second we can do the body but it doesn't matter what order we do this in so I'm actually going to do hmm let's do let's do the body so it says body and here it says data it's all the same thing so again we're going to copy and paste everything but we don't need the quotes so then we're going to pull this into the body and now we have all this data here so I'm just going to replace everything that is not correct so I need the name here no space I need the domain no space and then the web hook URL we actually don't need that so we're going to be careful about deleting this great so now this is going to be the body text I may have screwed this up and we can troubleshoot it together if I did now we have to add new key value pairs so again see how we have these headers that goes in header data I don't know why they call it data here and Body in other places like I said I'm not technical I don't know this stuff so we're going to take authorization and we're going to pull that in here and then we're going to take content type and we're going to pull that in here and we're going to take application Json pull that in here up here is where we're going to put our um API key I'm going to hide my screen for that though so we're going to do it last and then we're going to put another header except the application Json so put accept here and then application Json great and so now I'm going to get my API key I'm going to pause a little bit now I'm going to show this because it says failed to parse oh so it says here and it says fail to parse body input and exactly when I said I think we messed up I I probably know why so uh we're gonna fix that right now so I'm just gonna hide some things so you don't see my API key it said fail to parse the input body which means I did something incorrect here so when we look at this I'm just going to see if we got everything correct so it was like name I didn't know we need a web yeah see how it says the string is optional here uh yeah it's so odd maybe we're gonna try adding this comma here but the comma really shouldn't matter so let's just try to set it up again maybe it'll just fail the web hook URL there failed to parse body input oh whoops I had a space there maybe that'll do it that is so funny hmm and I'm not going to turn off the video as it might not be that engaging because I want to troubleshoot this together um um I wonder if we I'm gonna need these remember you do need the quotes no I might be full of it a poser guys okay now I'm gonna pause the video okay so I got it working and this is why Chachi petite is your best friend um so it was very funny so I this is literally what I asked I was saying hey I'm looking at API docs and this is what I was told to use for the API blah blah blah this is what I'm passing why am I getting this error and it was basically like hey do this like get rid of the backslashes and everything and now it's working and we can see the contact and this is great so uh don't be afraid to use Chacha petite when people are talking about it knows how to code it really knows how to code and so uh hopefully despite my troubles that I just found this video will help people who are looking to use web hooks uh and to use apis because when I first started in sales automation uh this was a big unlock for me to be able to actually use these things and I hope this video is helpful\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Using GPT-4 to Automate ABM Research

hey everyone in this video I'm gonna go over how you can do your account based marketing using uh lots of data or using Ai and so what I mean by account based marketing is when you have a list of 200 companies and you need to do really deep research on them how do you leverage artificial intelligence in order to find out everything that you should know that you can scale across these companies and so in this video we're going to go over how we can take a look at what job postings a company has and then deduct uh what problems are they trying to solve with those job postings the other thing that we're going to deduct is what the company's mission is and what they do we're going to figure out who their ideal customers are are they a B2B or a b2c company will figure out their average pricing and we're going to figure out the following of their social media accounts we'll also figure out some of their competitors so technographic information and some leadership changes in the past 12 months this is going to help us make some other things like uh you know some lines based on the job titles and what are the priority and challenges for the people that they're hiring and then we will also take a look at some other AI written lines as well so without further Ado let's jump into it and so this is our clay table here where we're hosting this data I just have a couple of companies in this list to just show as an example so for the first thing that we're going to do is we are going to find the active job openings that the company has and then use AI to determine what this company is looking to solve for so inside of clay we have the find active job openings via LinkedIn and then we could also use the Google jobs integration or we could use the predict leads jobs integration right it's fine to active job openings by domain we could use all of those all we need is the job description once we have the job description we can reach out to people and well we won't use this to reach out to people but what we're going to do is put in this prompt and we're going to say using the input job description summarize what problem the company is trying to solve with hiring this person the job description will mention day-to-day tasks but ignore those and focus on the Strategic reason the company is hiring this person also consider the description of the person and how hiring this person would help the company the job description to reference is here and the description of the company to reference is here so we're looking for the problems that they're trying to solve for what day-to-day tasks they're going to be doing and then how does that relate to the overall mission of the company and so an output for six cents and it looks like they're hiring for a support reliability specialist uh six sense is in the business of revolutionizing the process of B2B generation uh the company's core challenge that it seeks to address with the specified role of a reliability support is to enhance reliability speed and scalability of its services and infrastructure by hiring a reliability support specialist the company aims to ensure a Swift safe and reliable product to delivery through the improvements of its monitoring well the intended results here is to improve their services uptime great and contribute to their as they Max my Revenue great so we got some nuggets here they're looking to hire this person because they want to maximize uptime if you're a company that maximizes uptime boom this is something that you could be reaching out with and so uh this prompt it could be improved for your use case uh we didn't put any job title keywords in here so if you put in some job title keywords or some um job description keywords that would help you know okay they're having this problem that's how you would improve this prompt for yourself now uh it's super easy to figure out what the mission of the company is uh you literally just have to put this using the input what is the mission of the company keep the output under eight words and use specific words each output should contain my prefix the output should not include any quotation marks at all this is my prefix I was on your site and noticed you help and cool so then sixth sense I was on your site notice you helped predict engage uh predict and engage potential customers that's exactly what Sixth Sense does so now if you're looking to do account based marketing now we've knocked off okay they're hiring for this position and here's what they need to solve if you do something specific just ask Ai and say like are they looking to solve this problem right now and it'll tell you yes or no and now we have the uh mission of the company and so if you want to use AI to figure out the uh Pro the job titles that they usually sell to we can do that as well and so all we do here is using the input determine three customer types a company usually sells to this is the input and then we do the description output either three job titles that the company sells two or three types of people depending on what makes more sense keep the output to just the types of people or job titles and nothing else and so here this is important to give it examples because if you don't give it examples it's not going to know exactly what you mean and so I gave it some examples on a B2B company and I gave it examples on a b2c company so that it knows hey if I can give it job titles but if there's not job titles because it's b2c then we'll do you know types of people and things like that and so then that's our next one to figure out who they sell to the other thing that we can do here is we're determining uh oh no here what we're doing is determining if the company is a b2c company or a B2B company this prompt is very very simple uh I literally am like a B2B company is a company that sells to other companies a b2c company is a company that sells to Consumers using the input tell me if the company is likely a B2B or b2c company and we just use the company description and that gets us uh right there and so like most of these are B2B companies but if we check out this b2c right here who's this avo.com what does Evo do easy for people to research find and connect with the right lawyer yeah definitely be the same so great now a big one that's going to come up all the time average pricing what do they what's the pricing how do they charge and all of these things so this is a little bit difficult to get because of the messiness of people's websites and the way that they structure them I usually like to start with a Google Search and once I get the Google search I'm gonna do a site search on the domain and so this is literally like site6.com is basically what this looks like and so when I say site what that's doing is it's saying hey I want every search result on Google but it if the search results have to come from this website and then I want in url pricing and I'm saying you know whatever price like URL that you have I want that URL to have pricing in it and I want the dollar sign the reason I want the dollar sign is because if they ever put pricing in their URL and it's just a Blog about pricing I don't want that I put the dollar sign to get uh one of the dollar signs inside of the text on the page and so for some of these companies like this one six cents oh whoops so see like six cents we got their pricing page and I know you can't see this tab but I'm just telling you Sixth Sense does not allow you to see any pricing so that that's kind of a tough one it's just book a demo you can't you can't see anything and so if we I'm just gonna skip to one that we do have so see how this is branch.io pricing and then in this text we have the the pricing from them and it says the company offers two main pricing plans self-serve or Enterprise and so the way that we got that is because we got the link the first link that was had pricing in the URL and it had the dollar sign and then we use scrape website from clay to get the body text of what's on that page once we pull in the body text of what's on that page we use AI to determine what the output is and so a lot of these don't qualify because they're a lot of them are B2B companies and things like that um and so for instance like Clay is down here and it found our pricing page and it says the company offers three plans the starter plan the Pro Plan oh whoops and the Explorer plan great so the way I prompted this very very simple return the pricing of the company this is the input that's all I put because uh the the text is so large that I kept it really really simple and so what I would do is just get this and then if you need to use it in email further squeeze it down with another AI prompt and so then that's how I would get pricing uh and then this is one that I'm asked about all the time is how could I get a company's uh social media followers and so I used search Google here what we could have also done is we could have used the scrape website over here and see how in scrape website we have their Instagram we have their LinkedIn we have their Twitter if I if you just do a Google search for their Twitter account right and that's maybe what I even did oh that is what I did okay great and so all I did was just cite URL one URL one comes from the scrape website that I was just showing you as well and then we just have the followers and so then um the reason I put followers in here so in the Google snippet it shows up with how many followers that they have and so we can click on this and you'll see uh oh nope it's not in this one here's where it says how many followers they have and then we just ask Ai and I just put in the whole search result I say how many followers does this company in the input have boom and then I get the the followers from them so that one's not difficult as well competitors this is a fun one okay so in order to get competitors I played with this Google search a ton and I finally got it so I think the best way to do this and I'm open to suggestions and I might even change this one day is if you were to Google the company name the country that the company is in and then just competitors just that you should get pretty good results and so I'm even going to scroll down here and look at some of these and so um what this is going to do is it's going to pull results from similar web Zoom info CB insights uh G2 trust radius owler all of these different platforms and so what I did is I set the number of results oh I guess I set it to five okay great and um then you're going to get these results what's gonna happen is you're going to get like you see all these search results that you get so avo.com this is from similar web so their competitors are lawyers.com nolo.com martindalefinelaw.com great and then let's look at clay right and so we get this is G2 top 10 alternatives that's so funny that's not our competitors very funny but I have a way to get around this best Alternatives declare our air table clear bit and bow all right and great and so now some of those companies were not actual uh competitors to Clay how do we account for that thanks for asking so what we do is we put in the so first I wrote a formula where I just mapped the competitor search results and that was it I hope this is here so I said filter for just the text that is under the snippet category and that's all I wanted is just the snippet category I didn't need all of the extra extra garbage so then what I did is I used Ai and basically the premise I was looking for was tell me who the competitors in the lookup and do not include the company name that I'm looking up because they're they're their competitor I mean they're the company I'm looking for competitors for so don't include their name but basically I want um you to name if the if possible if the competitors mentionable multiple times name them this is the input and so um basically I was saying like the more times that it shows up I want you to name them and so then instead of you know some of those garbage results for competitors to Clay that's how we were still able to get airtable to get pulled out because it was putting it down um it just came up so much more often and so then that's how I would find competitors pretty easily and then predict leads also has a really good news source and so here we're just looking for just regular news and I automated you know a summary of that news article using AI nothing crazy here um so yeah predict leads has really good news data for you one thing that people were looking for was new senior leadership uh in the last 12 months and so the easy way to do this is to just use our integration called find contacts at company and I guess I'll pull that up for people that need to see it so find contacts at company is the one that I'm using here and I literally just put in 12 months and I could refine this and I could say Chief marketing officer vice president of marketing and I could see key leadership changes in the marketing department over here um and then all I did was I just found I just extrapolated the the first person in the list which now you can see the list is going away and so then we move through and let's look at here I can find people's recent LinkedIn posts this is just our LinkedIn post integration and I automated creating a snippet about the text in that post and then reaching out to them so I just wanted to reach out because they're so replaced about working on aav and T-cell products with Berkeley lights at phenome X so we could check it excited to continue to work on aavc sell products at a company at Phenom X okay perfect and that's exactly what we did so the way you prompt this super super easy is using the input to complete my prompt in under eight words keep the output short and use specific keywords from the post these are social media posts by other people super easy nothing crazy what did we do here here I deducted what department this person that I pulled over here is from um so you know their title is account manager and they're in the sales department their title is COO and they're in the operations department just another deduction to help you with your account based marketing and so the prompt is using the input tell me what uh Department that job title belongs to this is an input use well-known Department names like and then I just put in a bunch of Department names um if the job title were assistant marketing the output would be marketing and then I just gave it an example to just work off of uh and then here is where we synced the job description with the the company and so basically I found another open job um and I basically was like what comes what problem are they trying to solve I just did this again it's not that big of a deal actually based on the job description best egg seeks to improve operations and growth across various Financial products they aim to hire an operation strategy at analyst and you know pretty easy stuff and so um but let's see there's a couple other ones that are on this list like people ask me all the time how to clean job titles and that's super easy you just come in and you can browse our presets and then you can just clean contact titles and we'll just grab a job title from let's see new senior leadership and we'll just take it from this title and we can click on use preset we could preview the results and then run it it's super easy to clean job titles that way um let's see I think that's everything that I wanted to do on my list so again this video was all about how can we leverage artificial intelligence in order to automate your account based marketing if there's anything else that you usually like to search for when you do account based marketing just let me know uh I was trying to cover all of the things that the normal tools provide like hour and you know those kind of tools that that provide just static information about companies so yeah I hope you enjoyed it and let me know\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# 9 AI Generated First Lines you can Cold Email Anyone with

hey everyone in this video we're going to go over how you can personalize the first line of your cold email with artificial intelligence and just using the LinkedIn profile uh we're just gonna hop right into this basically you can see in this table that I've built in clay.com I've pulled a bunch of random LinkedIn profiles 80 profiles to be exact uh I'm not doing this for a particular campaign I'm just doing this to just show you multiple variations of LinkedIn profiles that we can make and so we get the LinkedIn profile we enrich it and then I just separated out their summary their title their education their experience and then the latest experience summary that they had and their location name just to uh move everything around and so the first AI line that I wanted to create is I wanted to create a line that would basically say hey you know the reason I'm reaching out to you is because uh you seem like a new idea person and I have a new idea for you that's essentially what all cold emails are for so I wanted to reference that uh you know like that that thing of like why I think that they're a new idea person in this email and so the first thing that I did is the whole profile is a little bit too much to uh handle on its own and so the first thing that I wanted to do is just narrow down exactly uh what makes them open-minded so I just made this uh prompt you know using the input write a sentence about why someone would be an open-minded person this input is a Json formatted text of a person's lengthy profile this is the input blah blah analyze the profile and look for you know like all of this stuff uh I didn't want it to mention anything about the college experience or the education cool I don't talk about like job hopping because that's not actually a compliment I wanted it to talk about promotions right we just like tell it all these things so then we get a summary and then it's like all right John girl list displays openness to new ideas and approaches to his ability to adapt and change strategies in different roles and companies particularly evidenced by summary for his current role as the head of global quality integration office at Novartis in which he completely redesigned their integration approach reducing total project Time by 50 so then we look at the line that we created so then we used AI to create this line um I saw on LinkedIn you've tweaked strategies like a pro looks like you've enjoyed thinking outside the box uh I would probably even change this line to prompt it to say like you know include specific reasons for why you're saying this um and then we would you know be able to move that forward because imagine if you got sent an email and you're like oh you know like and I reference your LinkedIn profile like that like this is a common strategy for sdrs to be doing and we could automate all of this with uh this artificial intelligence so let's just read another one uh hmm Andrew demonstrates open-mindedness by progressively advancing his career from a senior Analyst at Commercial Bank to Leading the Texas office at Morgan Stanley his progression into more senior roles in companies of varying sizes as indicated by a shift from Deutsche Bank to jll suggest a willingness to embrace new roles great so now let's see what the AI made for him uh I saw on linked in your career drums from commercial to Morgan Stanley so probably you're all about trying fresh ideas awesome I don't know about the people watching this video but this is basically what I was trying to achieve was like specifically saying like because of these things I bet you're open to new ideas um okay here's one that I've seen done a lot I was asked to do this one and it was about their college and so um I'm not a fan of reaching out to somebody and saying like oh like did you attend you know Rutgers go Scarlet Knights like that's a little bit too simple and so what I would want to do instead is I wanted to call out like a tradition that they have at that college and so here's how I prompted it uh we're just waiting for it to load and basically what I was doing is you know like I gave it the whole uh College input that we have over here from their education and then uh that gives it like the college name and things like that and then once it opens this up which is kind of funny that is taking a while once it opens that up then that's what we're going to be prompting Things based off of so here's our main prompt using the input call it something that students love to participate in at the school the input is a Json format I texted about a college person went to and what they studied this is the input don't mention what they studied at all in the output create a sentence about a school tradition nearby Landmark or something to do that students the school would participate in or know about keep into two sentences first sentence is where we saw that they attended the second sentence is a tradition uh prefix I saw on LinkedIn you attended great and so then we have like okay I saw you attended University of Kansas have you experienced the traditional Iraq Rock Chalk Chan at sports games I saw on LinkedIn you attended German State University did you ever kiss the bulldog statue for good luck uh you attended Randolph McComb college did you ever participate in the yearly Monument Avenue 10k run uh you attended University of Minnesota did you enjoy the University's tradition of homecoming festive not specific enough but that's that's fine for one is it true that students often gather at the button statue for celebrations yep there we go great I saw on LinkedIn you attended Wings is it true that students love hanging out at the Ruther Library cool and so it's just all calling these things out so then similarly we're taking the location and then we're doing the same thing um we're looking not necessarily for tradition for like something fun to do in the area so oh let's go over the prompts first and maybe while that's cool uh using the input which is a location create a sentence about a unique landmark or something fun to do near or at the location this location complete each output with my prefix I noticed uh on LinkedIn you're based in blah blah blah so I was on LinkedIn a notice you're based in uh DFW so Dallas Fort Worth this so this is an important thing to mention it's the other from Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex or a metropolitan area that I specifically prompted in the AI prompt to say like call it what the locals would call it when you give the output so I was on LinkedIn and notice you're based in DFW ever visited the iconic Reunion Tower for a panoramic City View um based in Kansas City you should try the famous barbecue at Joe's Kansas City Barbecue your basement yes ever check out the Mill City Museum uh amazing barbecue Joe's Casey awesome and you must that's a little general everyone's been the Smithsonian but that's a little tough I was on LinkedIn and noticed you're based in the DC Baltimore region have you ever visited in the National Aquarium in Baltimore before so see how it's like all very poignant the triangle wait the basement triangle hmm I gotta check on that one that's interesting oh okay back to location have you ever experienced the thrill of a Dallas Cowboys game okay great so all these different lines which we can change uh as much as we want um and so yeah and then uh in the same vein is the open-minded I wanted to try to create a line this is probably the biggest one that I would have to continue working on for this uh table I wanted to create a line that would basically find something unique about the person's profiles that we'd be able to mention it so not necessarily open-minded thing but I wanted something like really really really unique so I told it to ignore job experiences I told it to ignore like normal stuff I'm like what would you like point out I think I'd even say I think I even prompted it and I said um oh something that they would be complimented for at a dinner party was like what I was looking for and so again we're summarizing the profile first so that we can get it in one stage and then we're creating a LinkedIn line or a a first line in a second stage so we'll get something like uh Santa but he stands out for its impressive array of professional certifications from renowned institutions and roles in prestigious companies like Fidelity and IBM it's not on the Showcase commitment but also presents him as a highly flexible and diversified professional with an expertise in data and analytics transformation okay so then when we say I had a solid experience with professors from Harvard and Google awesome line great as far as like what's unique about them I think we nailed that let's go to Kindle tutor unique credential of lean Six Sigma yellow belt training certified from educate 360 which exhibits her commitment additionally a proactive leadership role in merging SunTrust and B B and T departments from the truest letter of credit trade Service Group showcases her leadership great I hope we call out that second part that would be absolutely phenomenal I saw on LinkedIn that you let a group merger and have a lean Six Sigma yellow belt quite a combo okay that's true they they did do that um let's do Sarah stands out for her impressive climb within the same company advancing assistant vice president to managers alongside dual roles as trust officer additionally her commitment to volunteering great so Sarah so I've been climbing the next estate she's supposed to volunteer a lot and education and arts awesome I'm just going to read one more the uniqueness of the links wise in the original impressive Suite of disaster recovery and resilience certifications from a diverse and highly respected organizations oh they speak a lot and this would be a talking part of the dinning party he had a talking point at a dinner dinner party yes exactly I saw on LinkedIn you've got loads of certifications in disaster recovery and resilience oh and you're trilingual too great so we're calling all that out um this one is probably even more useful than the others we're using AI to figure out how long have they been in the role and so you'll see that I named it as time and Department because uh if you have been in marketing at three out of the last five of your companies uh you have been in the marketing world for that time of experience right and so I was looking to group people's job experience by Department to see how much experience they have in that field because just because you do marketing for a pharmaceutical company and then you switch to a Manufacturing Company you've been in marketing for a long time but maybe not the same industry and so then we'll look at this so you've been on in quantitative research for over 10 years oh the other thing that I told it to do was I wanted it to talk about how long they've been doing their particular title so head of MBS quantitative research right and so let's move over oh actually maybe we should move that so we could take the title so this is their job title and then we'll move it next to their time and department so that we can see all of that coming together great so I saw you've been a managing director for around five years great head of operations I saw you've been to operations for over 10 years awesome you've been head of region America since May 2023 so you've been leading Data Insights for over three years great or four years so you've been in sourcing for over 10 years great all right so where I would tweak this one is it is I'm starting to find that it's just calling out how long they've been doing that role and it's not doing a great job of like how long they've been doing that thing so I'll manually check that it is very possible that that's just the way that it was um and like what was one of them bioinformatics eight years yeah okay we'll see I guess I gotta check on that one uh your clinical Solutions so like it might be tough it I what I might have to do is try to put these into standard departments first and then analyze it for how long they've been there but anyway so now these are getting into more of my favorite ones that we're doing over here and so I am also doing a roll mixed with the company description so we can say using the input write a sentence about the person's responsibilities for the company consider the inputs the job title and their description so that we could say on LinkedIn I noticed that you lead qualitative management at Siemens and you're ensuring the highest standards for sustainable energy solutions I saw on LinkedIn that you that you Strat what was that I saw on LinkedIn that you strategize the management spotify's content showcasing artists and inspiring billions of fans worldwide so we're combining like what is their title and what do they probably do at the company so we could say something like as you're doing this how are you considering blah blah blah and so we're just personalizing it to that title you know I saw on LinkedIn that you insured Global compliance and quality in likely contributing to Phillips mission of Health through Innovation great you lead strategic sourcing directly impact linkedin's ability to maintain productivity and success right so it's all about how can we foreign yet oversee operations so that you know USA for Siemens Health veneers oh that's interesting I wonder where we got health and ears from that's interesting so anyway we're combining okay I'm reaching out to you because I bet you have this role within the company and then I can ask a question of them after that then for this one this I'm calling you know why I'm reaching out so I'm combining the company that I'm reaching out as with their title and the company description and I used one schema as an example for this and so I'm saying sending this note because I saw on LinkedIn that uh you had Global service operations I'm guessing you manage multiple databases of customer data and may need efficient import Solutions and so that's like one schema's like thing that they do is they manage import Solutions and so we're reaching out to these people combining the title of their responsibility and what the company's mission is and then hitting them with like what does that have to do with CSV Imports a lot of these companies don't probably have a CSV import need so it's not the best example to show this off but I just wanted to show you that it is possible uh lead effect org Effectiveness I felt one schema could help you improve your data import processes for client payment details this is true but we wouldn't reach out to the person of org Effectiveness we do engineering saying is no because I saw on LinkedIn that you lead procurement for America as a tick tock I believe data could be a frequent task in your role if it's you know engineering it would be a lot different uh past company newsworthy this one was a lot of fun um so what I'm doing here is I'm looking at their past companies and saying like oh I saw that you uh used to work in this company were you there when this thing happened so I saw that and Linkedin used to work at Deutsche Bank did the 2015 restructuring affect your department I saw on LinkedIn that in the past to work the General Dynamics were you involved when they acquired CSRA in 2018 very very specific newsworthy events from these companies uh you worked at MetLife Stadium did you contribute to the preparations for the 2014 Super Bowl and then see how it's also calling out these dates we know when they worked at these companies because in the experience it comes with end dates here right so we have start dates and end dates and so it's it's looking for the company situation there um and then we just have this General first line which it's just kind of funny uh seeing how complicated these are this is just literally like you know I was on your site and saw you create Global inclusive products literally we're just taking the company description and then summarizing it and then putting it into an output it's nothing uh uh it's seriously nothing crazy but yeah that's what we're doing here so I hope you enjoyed this video I hope this gives you some uh ideas for what you can reach out to people with on LinkedIn by only using their LinkedIn profile of course you could do way more you know if you apply this to more things but I just wanted to give a lot more examples of what you could use with AI\#\# Date Posted: 2024-05-01

\# Growth Hacks That Worked In The Past

hey everyone a little bit of a different video today today I just want to talk about growth acts that used to work that uh either don't work at all anymore or they've been changed in some way mostly you to just reminisce and just have fun uh talking about these things but to also show you that a lot of these platforms they do have some kind of things that you can hack and anytime a new platform comes out that means it's usually right for you know some changes so for instance school is becoming a really big thing now school.com with SK L and I see people already trying to like hack the messages and and things like that and so um yeah I thought I would just talk about a couple and just reminisce a little bit so the first one is the Eventbrite Loom cold email exploit and so what you used to be able to do uh and oh you used to be able to do this Google forms too actually is you could just upload a list of email addresses and Eventbrite and Loom had no way of knowing uh you know if they're actual legit email addresses but the thing was you could do it in in gigantic bulk quantities so today you could cold email somebody a loom video and just share it with them and that would just work uh but doing it one by one is not interesting uh same thing with Eventbrite and same thing with Google forms and so what you used to be able to use do is add people to an Eventbrite or to the Loom or to the Google form via API and you could just Hammer them so instead of you setting up a bunch of domains and inboxes and all of these things you could upload them via API and you could be sending Eventbrite emails you could send Loom video or you could send Google forms um Loom probably caught on faster than anybody that they shouldn't be doing that Google forms got changed an event break got changed um as well but this was a really fun one because they were getting emails from other you know IP addresses and they they couldn't really stop you and it so it was It was kind of interesting on Eventbrite we would get like a 2% conversion rate on the events uh and the invitations and things so it was it was pretty funny but anyway um you used to be able to connect with a th people per week on LinkedIn and so the way you would do this and I think I'm going to call out another company uh lead hype as well we can talk about both of them so you used to connect with a thousand people per week on LinkedIn by exploiting the contact book feature and so basically if you had the personal email address or if you just had an email address that somebody had hooked up to their linkon account and it was in your contact book of your email you would be able to connect with those people automatically and so um so actually this is still possible to do today the only problem is is getting the personal email addresses is harder because lead hype would help us with that and so I'll talk about that in a little bit but also they shut down the automation to click everybody so there was a script that somebody made that you know you could get access to on Twitter or whatever it was and so instead of clicking a thousand times you would just activate that automation it would click everything for you so this is still possible but it just doesn't work the same way and maybe I should have moved this to the second half of the video but the big thing was lead hype was a company run by my friend Andrew who they were using fake LinkedIn accounts to scrape LinkedIn sales Navigator and they had a huge database of personal email addresses in their data as well so for $100 a month you could do a ton of LinkedIn scraping get the personal email addresses add them to your contact book of whatever email address that you had and then you would then say hey look at my contact book of my Gmail account and it would look at all of the new people of personal email addresses that you'd never connected with you could run that script and then you would connect with everybody so you could circumvent the thousand people per week and you weren't hacking anything like you weren't automating your LinkedIn account you were using a feature that they wanted you to use it's funny a lot of these platforms they want you to not spam but they're okay with spamming right because if if there's a personal email address that's not on LinkedIn they'll ask you to invite those people to LinkedIn which I think is really funny because you know they're cold emailing people technically too they're just saying Eric is inviting you to join so a little bit different but this used to be one of my favorites we would get the email addresses from lead hype by scraping a sales Navigator list upload them to your Gmail account as a contact import add and then view your contact book to add more connections and then there was automation to click all 1,000 still works today but the automation to click all thousand doesn't work so it it's changed you used to be able to run YouTube ads on a video um so you could pick the video and and I'm pretty sure this doesn't work anymore because I know they were sunsetting it and I haven't done this I haven't even looked into this in a long time so if I'm wrong leave a comment but I'm they were sunsetting it so we stopped and I'd imagine they actually sunsetted it so you used to be able to Target a particular video and say I want my ads run on this video and the reason they stopped it is because I mean we were one of these people too is what you could then do is you could make an ad that answered the same questions that that email did uh that that YouTube video did and then the watch time was ridiculously high so let's say there was a a video by um you know Alex Alex rosi might be too recognizable but there was a video by a YouTuber who is an expert in their field say there was one of my YouTube videos right and I'm not even saying I'm an expert in my field and I'm not even that big of a YouTuber let's you know kind of get that straight but let's say I had a video about email deliverability somebody else could put an ad on that video and then not make it look like an ad at all make it look just like this and say okay today we're going to talk about 10 tips per email deliverability but have calls to action for their service the entire time and so um the watch time was just crazy high because people thought they were watching the actual video um because when you think about it a lot of people when they're learning something new about cold Emil or about whatever it is they don't care about the Creator that they're actually watching you don't you don't know who that person is so when you click on it and somebody just starts talking about that and it doesn't look like an ad you know you might not just skip it and you might just keep watching the video can't do that anymore used to work really really well um and you could just hijack you know other people's Search terms and it was pretty crazy um it used to be a lot easier to create fake LinkedIn accounts and in the past two years they've really decimated uh creating fake LinkedIn accounts but um when you created the fake LinkedIn accounts you needed to use a dedicated proxy and then you needed to set them up and do all this crazy stuff what we found is if you could get the LinkedIn account past 500 connections people LinkedIn kept them alive a lot longer and so there were these people on LinkedIn called Lions I'm pretty sure and I'm pretty sure it stood for LinkedIn open networker and uh you could connect with them and you could really boost your your connections um but sometimes those people wouldn't connect with them and it was kind of annoying and if your a profile didn't look great they wouldn't connect with you so what we would do is to warm them up so we could get past that 500 connection so we could start outreaching through these Alias LinkedIn accounts we would warm them up and we would say we were a software engineer at Google and just all of the automations that recruiters have on their profiles would just Hammer the requ theh request connections and then we would just start doing that um so that one was really good that was that was a good one another one that just came to my mind that um used to work really well and then they got a C Sy assist was data for SEO which is a website that everybody should just check out for data anyway data for SEO used to have a similar web scraper and they were selling similar web data for like nothing and then they got a um cease and assist so you could query the API and get the similar web data uh it was really really really really great uh but they got a cease and assist so that one doesn't work anymore that wasn't really a hack because I mean they were doing the hack for you it's got a little bit different um when they first added the gbg4 functions or whatever it was to Bing people found that the open AI API token was in the search and you could use that API and you could get free access to gd4 and not have to pay for credits this was alive for like two months it was kind of cool was fun while it lasted but obviously they patched it you know super super fast used to be able to get sales naav licenses for $9 a big way that this was happening was organizations would buy gigantic sales naav packages and then they would go to third party resellers to basically because at an Enterprise level if you've got 5,000 employees they're only going to send you you know they're only going to sell you a sales naav license package you know in both so you've got 5,000 employees they'll send it sell you know or if you've got 4,500 employees they'll sell you a package of 5,000 sales naav licenses there's 500 left over so those companies would go to resellers and say hey we don't want to be paying for all these can you know split them up for us and uh you could do this and you could get a sales license for $9 I know a guy whose whole business was this and overnight his whole business got shut down um so anyway but you you used to be able to get sales licenses for $9 I'm sure there's some sche out there now that's doing this but anyway uh Howitzer that used to be really cool and so this company has pivoted to heyre but so um it Reddit is a great place to talk to people who are really engaged about topics because even though they're Anonymous it's very easy to tell they're very engaged about a topic because of the subreddit that they're uh a member of or the topics that they um comment on and so but it's really tough to get an account to send messages because Reddit has this really locked down so what Howitzer used to do is they have had their own fake Reddit accounts and they would keep building all of these and then what you would be able to do is you could go to Howitzer and you could say hey I want to message these people about this thing what you couldn't do is if they messaged you back you wouldn't be able to respond to them because you were just using fake accounts to essentially like Banner ad people and so um you could use their fake accounts message them on Reddit and then say hey check out the link here and blah blah BL blah Reddit found out about this and they knocked out all of Howitzer accounts in one big Fell Swoop and it's so it was you know kind of the death of a big growth haing operation but that was pretty good um yeah they pivoted to a new company now but that that used to be a good one uh sellas unlimited API so this used to be a lot more popular and I don't see people talking about it as much anymore but so sellas is a it's still around for sure sell I think it's sellens sas.com so this is a white label SAS company whose whole business model is to get other people to sell the SAS for them so you could white label this SAS company and essentially you could get contact data from it so it was like your own version of Apollo or you know I don't want to say it was as good as Zoom info but lead IQ or something like that and so it had um all these features and you could search for you know the CEOs of companies with 10 to 50 employees you know a classic like it was basically like you know a knockoff version of Apollo but what you could do is you could white label it and you could you know and people were you know selling it on their own so there was like icy leads is the one that I I was using the most and um I don't know there was all these things anyway what you used to be able to do is they had an API across the entire platform and you had credits on the platform well no I guess you had unlimited credits that was a part of their offer was you could do like $99 for as many email addresses as you want or something like that it sometimes included the mobile phone numbers too but so anyway what you could do is you could get a license on one of these platforms and you could just query the API and you could get as much data back uh from it as you wanted their email address data wasn't that great but the fact that they just knew that a person worked at a company was valuable so uh you used to be able to do this now they've patched it so I think you still have unlimited access to it but the rate limit is not worth it um so anyway that was a good one um web Summit is probably one of the largest tech events they' run another tech event called collision and um they used to have a web app that you would be able to scrape all the attendees and build lists on and and all these things as long as you paid for a ticket uh that platform that you scraped was their events platform and since websummit was one of the biggest Tech events there was a ton of other people who are using that web platform too and so if you could get if you bought a ticket and you had access to that web platform you'd be able to scrape everybody and then find their email addresses um with Google searches and well their LinkedIn profiles with Google searches and then enrich their email addresses but uh they then do not allow a web app anymore they only allow mobile apps which are a totally different games of scrape so it was uh that one went away too but that was another fun one and so these are all other hacks that they still work in some capacity but they're just totally way harder to to just get um so LinkedIn event invites it used to be way easier to send you could send a thousand LinkedIn event invites per day when they first started and then they changed it to per week and now I don't even know what the number is but it was super easy to send them to people who are in your ICP uh because of the filters that they allowed you to get access to and then they changed the filters you were allowed to get access to and then it just became like complete garbage um of what you could send out in bulk so um LinkedIn event invites it was like the best hack ever me and my friends we would get events with over 2,000 registrants and then it was so easy to put these things together we even forgot to run an event one time and we had 2,000 people who registered and we just didn't do it and we just completely forgot um so like I said this is still possible you could still run LinkedIn events and you invite people on the platform you still get a high response rate but the part that they changed was the bulk that you could do and so it just doesn't work the same way um you used to be able to go to open aai and get $2,500 of free credits and they were basically accepting everyone and it was super easy to get $2,500 free credits you like anybody with a website and an email address could get the 2500 um dollars worth of free credits now you I think this program still exists but it's way harder to get admitted so it just doesn't work the same um iMessage sending through Porter House this still works but you'll get flagged for spam so much faster so if you wanted to cold text people which I I don't even recommend that you do this when I first started my agency one of our very first customers wanted to do this it worked really well but it's not ethical and it's really annoying and I would just never do this ever again um it was like this was years ago so you we would message people through porterhouse because then it would come through as a blue bubble and all these other platforms are doing their automated texts this regular SMS from twio phone numbers or something but if you did it through Porter House it was an it was an iMessage and the response rates was so much higher because it would come through as a blue bubble and so um and it was coming from phone numbers that you controlled as well too the so this still works it's just it doesn't work as well because phone numbers are so much more sens itive to spam and so you get shut down so much faster or it shows up and it says hey it's more likely spam and things like that so just doesn't do the same thing have I been pwned email search so have I been pwned is a website that basically shows if your email has been a part of a data breach uh their API used to be completely free and the usage rate limits were huge and so now I'm not sure if they charge but the rate limits are the thing that you can't really work with anymore it's just so slow now that it's tough to do this stuff for oneoff stuff it's still work and so the have I been poned email search is basically like you would query their API with the nine different variations that people make of a business email address right because everyone's email address is like firstname domain.com or first name last name or first name. last name or first name hyphen last name or first name last name initial at domain.com and so you just like create all of these and just hit the API and just see which one came back and then you would say okay you know this might be their email address obviously you would still validate it with another Source but you didn't have to pay for the email address you just had the name and then the website and then you'd be able to get it from there and since Apollo's data uh they were hacked I forget what year but a lot of Apollo's data back when they were Zen Prospect is on that database as well and so is people data lab so a lot of times you were getting that source and they'll even tell you what source it came from so then you also knew how good it was um so for instance like the adobe.com data breach is on there so if you're looking up personal email addresses that's a really good one you can't do the same thing that I was just talking about because people do crazy things with their personal email addresses but um you could still query it and verify if a personal email address actually exists so that was another fun one that used to work really well like I said it still works it's just not the same then scraping a company's LinkedIn followers I'm pretty sure that this still works but it's a lot touchier so basically the Playbook here is you create a fake LinkedIn account you warm that LinkedIn account up and then you put sales navigator on that LinkedIn account that's another thing they changed you can't just start a LinkedIn account and then buy sales Navigator the first day you have to warm it up before you're even allowed to buy sales Navigator I think if they think you're a suspicious account and so then what you could do is you could pretend to be an employee of that company then you would join it and then there's a sales Navigator filter that's literally like like you can literally F like filter for followers of my company and then you could filter for that and then You' gain access to a company's followers and then you know you could filter by CEO or whatever and then you'd be able to scrape them with uh a sales Navigator scraper now it's it one it's just harder to create a fake account it's harder to get sales navigator on these accounts and then uh three it's um a lot touchier like just because you became an employee of the company doesn't necessarily mean that they just give you access to the followers anymore it's changed a lot um to the point I don't even know precisely how you get it done uh like what you have to do in order to gain access to the followers I know just you just wake up one day and you have access to their followers and that's how it kind of happens so um yeah this was oh and then this one people should just know about this one Google people chipping if you don't know about this one you should just I'm just going to put it at the end of this video because you should just know about it what you can do is you can go to a Google spreadsheet and then just like put in a email address and then click this hit insert smart chips convert to people chip and then see how we it got this you know gray box on top of it this is how you could validate an email address because this is Google basically saying that hey this email address exists in Google um so if we're going to do one that doesn't exist like um fyz D GTH engine x.com right and we can hit this see how it doesn't convert to a people chip and there's some like equals if statement that you can do to basically check if this is gray or not I forget I'm maybe I'll put it in the comments if enough people ask uh I just have to look it up and um then you would be able to you know then have like a huge bulk of like this is verified and this isn't verified the only thing is is that this still works even if the account is taken down so if I had a Johnny at growth x.com and then I deactivated that user it'll still it'll still people chip which is kind of annoying so you can't trust this 100% but if you need like a free email verification this would work um so yeah and it only works on Google accounts so if they only have an Outlook email it's not going to work if they signed up for a Google account with an Outlook email that'll work but you know how many people really do that so yeah anyway just a fun video of growth hacks that uh used to work really well don't or they somehow got changed and just the effectiveness isn't around anymore so I hope you like it it was a little bit of a different video today\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Overview of How We Use Apollo.io

all right so we're going to go over the basics of using apollo.io and their database be very clear that this is just going to be a demo of their database they have an engagement product they have a Playbook product or something like that I don't use any of those things so uh this whole video is just going to be about the the database and querying the database like I've said in other videos mainly what we do in my agency is we're using apollo.io bringing that data to Clay and then sending the the emails out um from there and so um Apollo is that first step on our workflow and it's because honestly it's because of their coverage like if you just look at their people coverage they've got 272 million people which you know like who knows how they kind of get that to that number but it's just really great coverage and then their company coverage is really large as well you also see that there's a lot of workflows that we use that are really important to um us um specifically around like one like one problem we had with other data providers is like every time I save a credit it's added to this saved list over here um other providers wouldn't give us access to those saved things and we'd have to keep reusing credits and now I know it tells me that like 10% of these people over 10% of these people have new job changes um and I get that but I'm cool with that and like we could just keep using credits over here and so um first we'll go over company filtering and then we'll talk about people filtering and so basically you have your highle stuff the most important filter that I found inside of Apollo that has been super helpful for us is in the company tab right here if you hit company filter open that up hidden inside of here is this include exclude list of companies you can take an account list and put this in here and it'll only search for companies that match those websites so if I put apple.com and then hit save search now we've got Apple iTunes xcode you know Apple's large enough that that that's what's going to happen but if I put in like clay. run or clay.com whichever one they actually I wonder which one they have yeah so great and so clay.com comes up here with all this information right and so what you can do is you can take a list from another place where you built your account list like imagine you build your account list in crunch base and their contact data is okay in crunch base you build your list in crunch base you bring it into Apollo and then you can like get all of the companies in here as well and so that's the first thing that I love to show people inside of Apollo account HQ location super super easy number of employees industry and keywords this is the one that we play with most often I'll be showing you later how we do like a call it like a poor man's lookalike audience search um by using the company keywords their filters are pretty much the same as what you get from public LinkedIn data buying intent we've played with this a little bit it's nothing crazy but you they have a buying intent platform the buying intent platform on the back end is called lead sift if you ever wanted to just look at their data um alone their technology data I've actually found so I've been told by the Apollo team that the technology data backing Apollo is built with data and and I've run these tests where if I were to build a list of Shopify stores using builtwith and then um pull the list of all the Shopify stores with like 10 to 100 employees right download that list upload that list of domains into Apollo and then filter down by the industries that matter because like Biden for America has a Shopify store the New York Times has a Shopify store um and and we don't want to contact those people right and so then when we filtered down for industries that made sense we got like 5,000 contacts whatever it was and then when we just used the technology filter inside of Apollo and then we just put Shopify and then used all of the same filters whoop CSC once we used the technology filter inside of Shopify I mean inside of Apollo and then filtered the industries that mattered it was basically the same list as well and so I know there's 470,000 companies inside of Apollo that qualify for using Shopify and there's like 9 million or five million I forget what it is um on built with a lot of those companies are companies that just launch a website and they set up there's some people who have 30 Shopify stores just by themselves so it's not like you're going to be able to find different contact information for for all of them and it might not even be public they might not release that they might might not announce it on LinkedIn and so um you're not going to be able to get their contact information so if you don't have access to built with oftentimes Apollo is just good enough revenue is okay um my big thing with revenue is if you ever want to be thinking about Revenue just worry about employee headcount the the big thing is you know see how they have 65,000 public companies I'm sure the revenue for that is pretty dang accurate because they release it publicly but for the private companies how would they know how do they know what the revenue is on these these private companies and so um anytime uh a customer comes to us and they're like oh I want to Target companies making 10 to 50 million in Revenue we we just say like what's the employee head count of companies you've worked with in the past because that Revenue size is it like even if we did search by it it's not going to be accurate so let's just skip it funding um to my understanding and if somebody corrects me I can change it um apollo.io funding information is from uh crunchbase so again if you don't want to pay for crunch base and Apollo you can combine all of them in here job postings my biggest problem with the job postings in Apollo is one they only track the top 10 and two they won't tell you the job posting so if a company is hiring for 200 employees and they have only the top 10 like and the first top 10 are all graphic designers you're not going to know that they're hiring for software Engineers um and my other problem is they don't tell you what the the role is so if they're hiring for a marketer it might be head of marketing it might be like a paid media marketer you have no clue what it is so you can't include it in your email so if we ever use job postings in Apollo which we never really do um we always do it with um oh will do a very specific job title so I'll say like sales development representative so we're like really really super specific scores is an internal thing they have signals is an internal thing that they have open up more filters you get access to a lot more sexy stuff that they're not showing you in the main UI and everybody needs to see this stuff some of this stuff is more interesting than than this main stuff so employees by Department this is super fun you can add in a new department and then like look for like how many people do they have on the engineering team like that one's really great head account growth you can look for ranges in certain time frames and within departments which again very cool for doing your targeting um industry and keywords we talked about already buying intent sick codes this is just like you know if you're looking for plumbers and you wanted to search by sick codes that like this would be able to help job titles oh if you want so so we're in the company's filter right now so if you wanted to build a list of all Shopify companies that have paid media people on the team Apollo would be able to do that for you funding we talked about founded year just another quick filter like if you wanted new companies or if you wanted companies that were founded over 10 years ago um news this is kind of interesting you can select a time frame for like leadership changes and Acquisitions and all this other stuff a recognition in some kind of award the only problem is they're not going to tell you what the award is so these are all kind of kind of tough um relational identified as compet edtor of interesting okay anyway then we can get into the rest of this the biggest one I want to show is account CSV import so um if you were to take a list of websites and import it into Apollo if they can match the website they'll unlock the whole company enrichment for that company for free inside of Apollo the same thing if you upload a first name last name and an email address um and then a LinkedIn profile just makes it better they'll unlock that whole contact for you in the people and so one problem that sometimes we'll have is like finding B2B SAS companies is tough in Apollo because of the way you do the filtering they don't really have a great filter for that and so what we just have in here is like the B2B SAS companies from harmonic and now anytime we need to build a list of B2B SAS companies we just hit these account CSV Imports and I know these are 36,000 B2B SAS companies that we can just pull and then yeah like a Google and Microsoft made it in here then I could just be like okay I just want the 11 to 20 cuz for I mean there's way more in the 1 to 10 range we just didn't upload them um this list was specifically 11 to 200 I think and then now what we can do is oh let's make this just one to 10 so now what we could do is we could go to saved right here hit select all people hit find people and now boom now we can do a people search which perfectly brings us into the next part of the video and so that's one reason I really like Apollo is because we could do that that filtering in the accounts and then flip it right into a people search um the other thing is the company search in the people search is kind of combined like you can do a lot of the same things you just can't in a people search you can't do an account CSV import which for B2B SAS that's why we start that way and so you could search by job titles location employees industry and keywords their email status which if you um you know Apollo will charge you credits for emails that aren't valid and so um what I found is we've sent to emails that they claim are verified and then we've sent to emails that we didn't clean and it was just from Apollo we had like a 20% bounce rate and then when we sent to emails that were verified by Apollo we had a 6% bounce rate so if you don't want to waste credits on um emails and you want it to be super clean download only the verified emails and then use like a list cleaning tool because 6% is still is still too high um so you could do a lot of the same filtering on the person search uh it just you know you gota you know you got to play with this depending on what you're what you're doing here right and so uh what else did I want to show so um what we'll do when I say like the poor man's lookalike search right is so what I mean by a lookalike search is you have 30 customers in the past and you want to find companies that are similar to those 30 companies in the past right and so there's a company called ocean. that does this really really really really well but they're super super expensive and so the way that you can do this using apollo.io is what I like to do is I like to just search the company that I've sold in the past and I'll just be like okay gong I I'll open up two tabs for this actually and then I'll just work on this so I'll be like all right gong and I say okay cool it's an information technology company I can't so what we really need is we need keywords and I can't believe they don't have keywords wow they don't have keywords in Apollo that's kind of crazy okay so they don't have so let's do another one let's do Salesforce right so we want companies that look like Salesforce so we'll come in here and we'll take a look at their keywords and we're like okay boom this is what we're looking for whoops oh now it's searching only for that keyword but I just clicked and I shouldn't have clicked now what I'll do is why won't they give me access to all those keywords that's so annoying yeah all right so this is why I open it in two tabs because we just do it like this so now I have the keywords in front of me over here and then I'll put in the relevant ones over here so we kind of hover and we're like customer relationship management right customer relationship manager CRM right all of these keywords for them software depending on what we're searching for is too broad here right we don't want to include that information techn te ology might be too too broad we want other crms right so we use this keyword and then we go from there so now we can look up another keyword we say HubSpot and then we just get ideas for what these companies look like and so then we get the keywords from HubSpot we say okay great content marketing automation okay I kind of want that too so we'll say content marketing automation great and so we could use this keyword section to find all of the companies that would be relevant and then we can narrow it down with the industries to just make sure that we're really talking to correct companies and so you eyeball it and so Louis Vuitton is is not good right so then we would come in here and we'd say exclude keywords fashion right I don't know how Louis Vuitton is possibly like you know qualifying for that and then what we could also do is we could also make the industry only industries that are good qualifications so like information technology and and computer software is also going to clean up our list a lot and so cool now we shouldn't have like a crazy like Louis Vuitton brush Works netw week open Tex yeah cool and so the reason why you get so many of these ibms is just because like there's so many different business units that get put into Apollo that that's why you're seeing all of these make sure you D duplicate it if you're using a lot like see how many hubot we have over here it's pretty crazy and so um yeah anyway that is like a quick overview of using Apollo it's a pretty easy simpl to use platform um and this is where a lot of our like main main list building starts from\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Clay Challenge 1

so if any of you are like me you want to get your hands dirty I have set up this little challenge that we're going to do inside of clay that if you want to learn how to use clay this is a really easy way to be able to uh get your hands dirty and find some data so this is the uh spreadsheet it's literally called clay challenge one um all you have to do is make a copy of it or just download it do not request access from me just download it so we're going to download this comma separated list and then we're going to bring it over to Clay and we're going to start our challenge so we're going to import the data and here we go so hit continue new blank table complete the import and so the challenge that we're going to do is we want to validate if these people's email addresses are legit and then we want to find what technology these companies are using basically we want to check are these companies using using HubSpot and then we are only going to send an email to somebody if their company is between one to 50 employees and we're going to do that with a formula so step one like I said clean up these email addresses see if they're valid and then we're going to enrich them for more email addresses then we're going to find which companies are using HubSpot and then we'll send an email only to the companies that are um one to 10 No 1 to 1550 whatever 1 to 50 employees maybe I'll change it by the end but we'll see so step number one we need to clean these emails up so we're going to go to enrich data and what we could do is we could just click on emails here and then there's validate email provider so if we were to just put validate or we went to the emails see how we have all these validation providers so we can choose any of these we're going to just use debounce so we use debounce you can use your own API key or use clays for this example we going to use Clays and I need to map the email so where are those emails ah yes email is right here so we want to only uh get safe to send emails um and do we want to exclude free emails yes so we're going to say only safe send to send emails and exclude free emails see how this one is like a Gmail email address right there which the way that they are this is probably the email address that they actually use for business but I don't like emailing Gmail accounts see how it's America photog gmail.com this is probably what they use because they're like a producer and so this is probably their legitimate email address but I don't like emailing free emails so we're not going to do it so we're just going to validate all of these we're going to hit save and run those rows and then we're going to get an answer back on all of these and so see see how what it says is first possible valid email so we're going to add that as a column and we're going to hit create so now see how it says one valid so valid email EMS this one is safe to send first possible valid email now we know okay these emails are safe to send to the rest are not safe to send to which is perfect so now we're going to set up our waterfall so we're just going to add our enrichment we're going to hit work email so now we're going to set up our waterfall so that if they if we didn't get an email address from our sheet that is valid we're going to try to find more email addresses so we're going to hit full name a little bit of snafu um you need full name I guess to be in one um column so we're just going to use a formula really quick to put this together so I'm going to say concatenate first name and and then we got to put a space in between it so we put quote like space so it knows and last name because if you just if you did this without the space it would literally just be e r i c n o la aw and like it wouldn't have a space in between so you just have to do that hit generate form formula so now we went from Jeremy emmerman to our full output over here which is exactly what we want to do and now we're going to set this up again so if we have an email here we don't want to run our email enrichment column but if we don't we do want to run our email enrichment so we'll hit work email we're going to map the full name we just used and then we're going to use the company name from the we I mean the company domain from the website and we're going to drop down we'll hit run settings and so now we're going to use Ai and I'm going to say run if first possible valid email is empty right keep in mind if there's no data inside of it if it's empty that's when we want all of this to run so we'll hit generate formula output is correct and then we've selected debounce as our email validation provider again so even if prosio gives us an email we'll have debounce to verify it let's save and run first 10 rows and now it automatically added everything so see how here we have the email address and it doesn't even run on prospo it's like nope we already found the email address we're good we don't need anything so now while all this is editing another quick tip is that um the validated work email this is technically a merge column and so if we were to jump in and we were to edit it this is like I said this is the way that a merge column works we could add uh this first possible email as well as an put oh I guess we can't I guess we're going to have to well we'll merge them ourselves so what's going on here is that this domain has to be a uh catchall domain and so what we mean by that is that um aroint labs.com if you validate it there's no way to validate it and like I wrote a whole blog on this it's going to be included in the course that um what a catchall domain is essentially there's no way to validate a catchall domain all of these providers though are saying yeah this is a the catchall domain so it kept running because debounce would validate it and it would be catchall so then it would go to the next one but because all of them got it that's why we got this over here and so now we've set up our email enrichment and so now we are good to go so we're going to actually we're going to let this run on we're going to let this run on everything now so that we can complete all 25 rows so now what do we want to do we want to find who's using HubSpot now let's keep in mind though if we want to find who's using HubSpot we have to use builtwith right because people install HubSpot on their website sometimes they put it in their job descriptions and don't put it on their website but for this challenge we're just going to do the company domain builtwith costs us two credits every time we run this so what think to yourself like what do we need to do here to to check right so we're going to put HubSpot as the keyword but what else should we do if we want to save money we also want to put the Run settings so that it'll only run if first possible valid email has data or if the validated work email over here behind this has data because if we don't have their email address I'm not going to be emailing them anyway so why would I waste money on this so I'm going to put use Ai and I'm going to say run if and then we're going to go to First validated possible email is not empty or if validated work email is not empty so now we don't waste any money on enrichments that we're not going to email anyway so we'll hit output is correct save formula and then we'll continue to add Fields um I'll put the Technologies found here that's fine and so now see how it only runs when we have the the email addresses um really quick what we're also going to do is I want to make like a master email column because we have the validated work email over here and we have it over there so just real quick we'll use merge columns which literally if I just map first possible valid email and then I map the validated work email then whichever one is in there is just just going to get merged into here and this will kind of be like our Master email column right so now we have the full list of all the emails that we have so then we'll run this on everything and so now we're prepared to write a formula where so I'm not actually going to send this email to any um sending platform because I don't have a campaign set up for these we're just going to use a formula to just pretend and so I I just want to run through everything one more time because I know I speak fast and I go really fast so I'm going to give one more overview of what we did why we did it and everything so first what we did is we uploaded this CSV right so this is the challenge this is what you need to be working off of if these people all leave their jobs and this doesn't become possible reach out to me and I'll change them you know it doesn’t matter so then what we also have here so I mean no we uploaded all of this data right and so we have the email address from the data we need to find more we need to clean this email and we need to see who's using HubSpot and so first we use debounce you can use debounce zero bounce whatever you want just like pick an email validation provider in my opinion they're all basically the same um so you're going to run your integration here and then we found out which ones were clean already and then we moved on and we said okay now I want as many email addresses as I could possibly get these ones we got from Apollo we want to see what else can we get so we take the first possible valid email and we’re like okay we don’t want to find any more email addresses for these people so when we set up our waterfall we said hey if there’s an email address here don’t run because we already have the data which is why it’s not even run here um on our data providers then the waterfall of all the data providers got used and then we have the validated work email over here so now to see who’s using HubSpot though we have our lookup techn technology with built with we put in HubSpot but in order to not waste any money we only ran it if there was Data inside a validated work email and if there is data inside a first possible valid email um we could have just created the master email column first and then just said like only run if there’s data inside of Master email column but you know you could just do it whichever way you want so now we have Technologies found HubSpot HubSpot messages and these are the only two so when you integrate this with lemlin uh smart lead instantly you're going to have to run a conditional formula and so I’m not going to choose an account I’m not going to pick a campaign um you’re basically going to set this up in order to map everything right and so we would map the master email column we would map their first name we would map their last name and then we would map all of our customizations our custom variables all of those things the only reason though we want this campaign to run is only if they have HubSpot a valid email and I guess their name right so what we would do is we would use a conditional formula here and we would say hey only run if first name is not empty and master email column whoops is not empty oops and then we go into here Technologies found contain s HubSpot we could also do is not empty as well because we filtered for HubSpot but we could put is not empty and so I’m just going to copy and paste this so if we were actually adding this to a campaign we’d be able to generate this formula and we would be good because we’re not adding it to a campaign and this is just pretend we’re going to say we’re going to run a formula and so I’m going to say I’m going to copy and paste and I’m going to say output send if Matt first name is not empty Master email column is not empty and Technologies found is not empty output no send whoops no send for everything else we’ll hit generate formula great and so now this person has a first name they have a master email column they have Technologies send right so we’ll hit output is correct save formula so see how this person has Technologies we would hit send and so now this should be a pretty easy workflow for you to do for your first time in order to just mess around with the platform and you know get familiar with conditional formulas it should end with uh and you can check to make sure that you did everything correctly because if you filter this by the same criteria and you say first name is not empty and master email column is not empty and Technologies found is not empty you should only get get the results that say send over here which is a way that you can check that you did it correctly so um Yep this is challenge number one like I said I like to get my hands dirty when I'm using tools I think this is a great way to you know use just a tiny like 25 sample set in order to find these people um make a copy of the sheet download it well I guess you don’t need to make a copy you could just hit file download upload it into clay great first challenge for you to you know work your way around clay and do things that you’re going to do all the time I think the most basic thing that we do all the time is validating an email from whatever Source we got it from enriching it for more email addresses doing like one or two enrichments and then sending off of that so there you go clay challenge number one\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Clay Beginner Guide

hey everyone I am making this video to basically go over a lot of the skills and nuances of working inside of clay.com and basically in my opinion if you could do all of the skills that I'm going to go over in this video you will be a very proficient user in clay.com and so what we have here is we just have some data that I downloaded from a data provider and we are going to turn this data into a whole bunch of stuff and so the first thing that we're going to do is I want to find these people's uh LinkedIn profiles so there are two ways that we could go about this we could hit enrich data we could pop down to LinkedIn and we can either use find people or we can find an enriched person from Google Search now find an enriched person from Google search uses two credits find people uses one credit so we're gonna opt for find people first now when we click into find people it says we need a company identifier and that's either a LinkedIn URL a company domain or a sales Navigator URL and so we don't have any of that but since we do have these emails here we do have their domain so we're actually going to do is we're going to back up a little bit and we're going to hit clay and there is a extract company domain from email address function here that we're going to use so then we're just going to click inside of the input and we're just going to click on email to input that there and then it's going to prompt us to pull this out and so we're just going to add get the domain so we'll throw that in and now it's going to run and we're good to go it just runs the first 10 rows just to protect you from burning all of your credits but now we're good and we have the domain so now we will go back to LinkedIn and we'll hit find people and now we have our company identifier so notice how before all of our data ended at email but now we have extract company domain from email address to pick from and we have domain to pick from so we're going to click on domain and then we are good to go so for the job title keyword we are going to insert their title down here and then for names we're going to put their first name and see how we put the token in for first name now we're going to add a space and then we're going to put last name so we're all set so we'll be first name last name their title and the domain will be set to go so now we'll just hit URL save and run first 10 rows foreign and so we did not find all of the profiles which not to worry at all when we go for the find people search so now what we're going to do is we are going to go over our first conditional run so find people found uh basically four profiles here but we want to finish the rest of them the way we save credits inside of clay is by using conditional runs and there's other reasons why we use conditional runs but basically what we're doing with a conditional run is if we have the data here I don't need to run this one because see how it says two credits I don't want to spend two credits if I don't have to spend two credits so if there's data here then this one isn't going to run and I'll show and we're going to set that up using the Run settings so first we're going to make the search query be first name and like I said space last name and actually we're going to put that in quotes and then we're also going to put the title in quotes and we're going to put the company name and in quotes now for run settings we are going to use the AI formula generator and we're going to say and literally we're just going to type in only run this column if and then backslash to pull up our inputs if this is not empty okay generate formula and we are good to go and it gives us a little bit of a preview see how it says you know will this run uh no oh whoops actually we got this wrong only run this column if no oh so sorry is empty whoops see if we even make mistakes that's why we have to use that preview I was showing you how to use the preview so basically this is empty will it run yes this is empty will it run yes this is full we'll run no perfect so we'll hit output as correct say formula and now we'll just click continue to add Fields again we will just add this person's LinkedIn profile there it is and we'll hit save and run first 10 rows and see how it says run condition.net that just means that we are not looking for that person and we are good to go here so now we might want all of these LinkedIn profiles to be located inside of one table uh and one thing I want to call out before that is if there's no profile found a lot of times that just means that the profile is private I wouldn't worry about that too much um these are the ways to find these profiles and so now we are going to merge the data in this column with the data that's in that column the way that we'll do that is with the plus button and we get all of these different additional columns that we can add we're going to add a merge column and we're going to make this a URL you don't have to do that I'm doing it kind of just for the fun of it so first we're going to go to URL people and then we're going to try just URL then we'll hit save settings and then we have all of our LinkedIn profiles right there and so if we run all rows here and we run all rows here it is going to this is going to wait for it to be no profile found here before it gets activated which that's exactly what you're seeing right here and then it goes out and it finds that data and so this is just a little lesson in finding LinkedIn profiles if you don't have it uh as well as merging columns over here and some conditional formatting over here now if you do have LinkedIn profiles no worries do not do any of these steps just click on enrich person from LinkedIn profile and map their LinkedIn profile here and you're good to go uh one thing to call out is that a LinkedIn uh profile is a linkedin.com backslash in backslash you know James teslit right or however you say that person's name uh this is a LinkedIn URL we call this a LinkedIn basic URL there are also LinkedIn user ID and Linkedin sales Navigator profiles if we look at this this is what's called a VM ID if you put this into LinkedIn profile it is not gonna work and so if we click on any of these profiles I'll show you kind of what that looks like so the user ID this person ID would be a input into enriched person from LinkedIn profile like we were seeing before and it doesn't look like we have the VM ID here but the VM ID I showed you before and so you usually wouldn't use that but if you're like scraping sales Navigator you'll you'll see that stuff come up so uh then you would just change your inputs so that you don't get a bunch of Errors back when you're doing a rich person from LinkedIn profile so always make sure you're using the correct ones next what we are going to do is we got these emails from a data source so what we're going to do is we're going to clean them and if we don't find a valid email we're going to attempt to find a new valid email so we're just going to go to Providers and we are going to go to debounce and we're going to hit verify emails and we are going to map the emails into the email section now I only send to valid emails so I am only going to use the safe to send email so I'm going to turn that on and I'm going to hit run and I'm going to take first safe to send email I'm going to map that to the column and then we're going to be good to go so now it is running all of these emails and see when we find an email it comes into this column so now uh we know that the email that we got from this data provider was correct but if we want to get even more emails we can use the clay find work email function in here to find even more and so we'll just set up all of our inputs and again our run settings we're going to account for the fact that we only uh run this column if and then we're going to put email first save to send email is empty we'll generate that formula and again we're just going to check okay this is empty it will run yes this is full no it will not run okay looks good output is correct save formula and then we will just map the email great so we are already starting to find more valid emails from our list than what we originally started from and again you can guess it we're just going to merge these together once more uh we'll do first save to send email it doesn't actually matter the order because of the way that we have this logic set up but that's fine we'll just merge it all into one column excellent so now we have all these email addresses again just practicing finding email addresses I always verify emails when I have it from a different source and then I stop using any enrichment if find work email doesn't find it the reason I do that is because find work email is essentially guessing Eric nowoslavski at clay.run Eric dot noislowski at clay.run Eric clay.run all of these different permutations of my name and if that doesn't come back valid then it won't return a valid email address for me I don't enrich it any further than that because if it doesn't come back with that you're probably not going to get a good email from the other data providers so that's why I checked this second these are valid emails so I don't need to validate these again and I'm ready to send to these emails the next thing that we're going to go over is how to personalize an email using artificial intelligence now I've made a lot of videos on this but the main thing that I want to include is basically you need to know the basics of your prompt and you need inputs for your prompt so we're going to write a first line based off of the mission of the company currently we do not have the mission of the company in our table so or the description of the company that we're going to derive this from so we're going to go to our providers we're going to hit LinkedIn we're going to hit enrich company and then we're going to map the company LinkedIn URL now you might be thinking as yourself we don't have the company LinkedIn URL anywhere and actually I we do have it here and the way that we have it here is because when we did find people and we did find in a rich person from Google Search we got the company URLs in there and if you click into all of these you will basically see if we scroll down to latest experience that we have a company LinkedIn URL right here and so that is what we're going to use first is that company LinkedIn URL and so I will map the description so that we could do that nice and easily and it's going to have a lot of missing inputs because we had find an enriched person and find people uh like that which is totally fine then so we have this description here and this is all going to to work out so now what we want to do is we want to converse with chatgpt and we're basically going to say uh in one message we're going to create a prompt and so prompts all have the same format I'm going to type it out and then I'm going to explain the the prompts format foreign and so I said using the input create a first line for an email about what the company's mission is this is the input keep the output under eight words and use specific keywords from the input complete each prompt with my prefix the prefix is this blah blah blah right so basically our format for prompts for basic prompts is just stipulate that you have an input and what do you want it to do with that input stipulate the input give it some guard rails to focus on and then give it a prefix and the prefix really helps increase the quality of of your output then we'll go to run settings and we want to make sure that it will only run if description is full now if you ever only want something to run if there's data inside of the column you don't need to use AI for that you can just click on description and when it's written like this this will only run if description has data in it so we'll just hit that and we'll hit content and then we will run and we could check out our content I was on your website it looks like you have helped people come back clinician burnout with innovative solutions or what was it going to say for Lockheed Martin it looks like you connect customers with advanced technology systems yep that's true it looks like you help people achieve Technology Innovation and client satisfaction okay awesome and so that is a quick way of how you use chat gbt and use that inside of your clay table um and now here's a fun one we are now going to find people at a company and what we're going to do here is we're going to find a person at the company who is not the person that we're reaching out to and the reason for that is I like to reach out to people and if I'm reaching out to the CEO I like to say something to the CEO if I'm reaching out to the CMO I like to say something to the CMO and when I get to my final email I like to say oh you know I know there's a lot of people at the company is this something better suited to speaking with the CMO about Jane um or Susie should I be speaking to the CEO right and we can basically name those things in there so we'll use the company identifier and we'll do the domain job title keywords we'll just make it CEO owner president uh owner president founder chief executive officer co-founder all of these things and then we'll go and we'll say like chief marketing officer CMO head of marketing things like that now in order to not have any repeats of these people and so see we have all these people and it would be so embarrassing if we're reaching out to Ryan and we say hey Ryan I know you're the founder of this company should I speak it uh speak to Ryan instead what we're going to do is we're going to have a job title exclude keywords here and we're going to exclude their title here so that while we're searching we don't find a person who has the same exact title as them uh and so then in that way we know that we are bringing up a person that is completely new and so now we're going to put the limit to just one and then we could continue to add Fields we'll save and run the first 10 rows and so now again we're just using find people to find these different profiles and so you can see this person's name is Megan and they are the whoops vice president of creative awesome and that came up because we typed in president so you actually have to be like super clear uh about your stuff but so anyway oh wait this person is Christy Megan so they're not the same people awesome and they they have a similar role so this is pranante and I don't know how to pronounce that name but excellent they're not the same people and so this is oh the final skill that I would just want to go over quickly is then you could send all this data to anywhere that you are you know building databases like Google Sheets or airtable or that you're sending emails from like instantly limb list or smart lead um I even like sending some of this stuff to slack too and so uh that in that way you would just set up all of your criteria I like to edit this I like to go straight down to run settings and run as button I turn that on just so that when we input all of this um it's uh won't just automatically run which clay will start doing that and uh then you just input all of your text inputs like we just did and you'd be good to go so hopefully I accomplish my task of if you have never used clay before this goes over a lot of the skills that you would need in order to be able to use clay we went over how to find a person's LinkedIn profile how to set up a conditional run in case uh we don't want to waste credits then we set up email validation and then again finding some emails and then we personalize some messaging and then we even found some more people at the company to personalize by uh so let me know if you have any questions as always\#\# Date Posted: 2025-02-01

thanks for taking the time to watch this video today I'm announcing something extremely exciting for us at growth engine X as we've been working on this validating this and building this for maybe the last six months we are now announcing that we are able to launch cold email campaigns for free for people who want to become customers of growth engine X who fit a certain amount of criteria around lifetime value of their customers as well as being B2B companies and things like that but in this video what I want to do is I want to go over how we do this why we do it and if it would work for you as well too and so the first thing I just want to get into is I think that proof is always incredibly important so if you don't know who I am my name is Eric no lowski I run a outbound agency called growth engine X and in the past year we've generated over 10,000 positive responses and this is just coming from our uh internal database from our smart lead if that number sounds utterly unbelievable instantly. is one of our customers and obviously we don't use Smart lead to send with instant lead at AI so the only customer that uh or well the only email address they have tied to me to be able to give me this award is just the email that I use to run their outbound campaigns and they have certified that we got 5,000 B2B sales opportunities in the past year as well too so if this number sounds crazy we had a third party instantly. a send me this awesome plaque so I hope you can see that I I'm not just making this stuff up we really track these numbers because I think it's important to see how many positive responses we get currently we manage just over well I guess this image says under 50,000 uh Google and Microsoft inboxes we actually manage over that now since I made this in the past I've even done webinars with Alex her Moi and my friend Enzo there which was great and then I'll release this uh presentation but this is a bunch of people who are giving us Kudos on our content saying we're you know Eric is one of the leading outbound experts Eric was one of the best in class for AI generated email uh you know just people sending recommendations or just commenting and just saying really nice things or we have a list of people uh that we have that we've gotten positive responses from see we got a positive response from Boston Dynamics here and then we said had this person say great email and you know all of these different things so if you want to look at this we can look at it but uh I'll link the the document so we don't get too sucked into this so what are we doing here with these free campaigns right so first off why are we doing free campaigns well I found that most of our customers we could tell if a offer was going to work basically within the first three days of a campaign so I thought to myself okay how can we launch a campaign as fast as possible and in doing so I think we can do it for people for free and so if you know anything about cold email you need to buy domains and you need to warm up those domains so you can start sending email and if you don't know about that you can watch my YouTube channel and learn more about that but you can't just buy a domain and then start sending emails so so what I did is I purchased over a thousand domains that kind of sound like growth strategy Consulting I won't actually give the domain names here but we could talk about it if you're concerned um and we purchased these generic domains and I've been warming them up for three months so we have real Google inboxes on all of these domains we have over 2,000 Google inboxes and we're keeping them warm at all times what we then do is what we found and this is what I've spent six months validating well I it only took us a month to validate this but this is what we spent a lot of time validating was that could we send a campaign and do people care where the domain comes from and I'm going to show you that people don't care where the domain comes from it allows us to get started earlier for you and then we could create branded domains and make sure it's under a sales rep from your team or you know anything else from there as well too so we have these domains warming for you we don't let anybody use the same domain so as soon as somebody runs the test with some of the domains we don't use them anymore we turn them off and we turn on new ones and start the warmup process on those we over 2,000 those we're good we we have a lot to go over we've built a way that we can build your list uh right in front of you on the call and then we can export that list from apollo. and we have ai that does the copyrighting that we uh get a first crack at it with AI and then we edit it together on the call as well too so when you want to run a free test with us the only thing that we need is just a confirmation of who you want to reach out to and then we have uh the copywriting the first bat is done with the AI and then you and I can go over it together or somebody on my team can go over it together and then you can figure out if it uh is actually something you want to send and then we use clay to send one to three personalizations in the email I always think that the best email that you could possibly send is the same email that you would send if you were to manually research a company and then you were to insert things from that clent has just gotten so much better and so much more accurate uh and if you don't know what clent is it's an AI agent that can do research about companies or about a person so as you'll see later we have really sophisticated asks from some people in the free test and with clay and clent we were able to do it extremely quickly and uh then we send between 1,500 and 2,000 contacts sometimes we send less if we validate it earlier than that and we try to figure out uh if cold email is going to work for your offer okay but then some of you might be asking has this worked in the past these are just three companies that it's worked for the past before and I just put them into the presentation like I said we've been working on this for 6 months it's worked for more companies than this but I just want wanted to include these three to just highlight them and so first boundless Max now the biggest question people ask me is will people take these generic domains seriously and I always say of course your branded domains are going to get more serious traction but these generic domains as long as people resonate with the message they don't actually care what the domain looks like so what this company does is they are an IT asset disposal company and so basically we email people and we say hey do you have laptops that are lying around and you want to get rid of those laptops you know we can help you get rid of those right now when a company gives or they sell their laptops or somebody buys their laptops there's a lot of security that goes along with that right as well too so this company they need to be certified there's a bunch of certifications that they need to get and our domains that we were using were pointing to their website but they had nothing to do with the website and they still closed deals and he picked up 2 200 Chromebooks which was a so total of six truckloads worth of material that must been crazy and they worked with Korean Air as well and both of these came from our generic domains so not only has this worked this person closed deals from this as well too and they didn't even get to the stage where we were using their uh branded domains they were still using our internal domains as well too and so for those of you who might be asking oh are these generic domains going to work they absolutely do and this doesn't wasn't just some you know marketing agency that had no security and these it departments wasn't reviewing anything you know these it departments need this company to have certifications and it still worked for them and it was super awesome to see this then we have another company where they do Google uh reputation management and so then see I wanted to include this to show kind of the craziness we could do with AI see we only sent 195 emails they came to us and they said they sent 3,000 emails and they didn't get a single positive response I suggested copy that they should try uh with these custom variables they took the custom variables out and it still worked for them and then we used the custom variables and it worked even better for them so see what I mean by custom variable is this part right here the one about rrg Roofing doing substandard carpentry work that wouldn't pass inspection this is a custom variable where like I said we're using clay to research the company and figure out what would you manually send anyway we found a negative review and we're saying hey I had a question about the negative review on on Google the one about this is this having a negative impact on your business we help people remove would you want to talk about that see we got this positive review here can I choose the reviews that are removed awesome then we say hey I had a question about the negative review on Google the one about the insulation and dust bursting out of the attic how much do you charge for removal okay great hey had a qu now this one's my my favorite I think this is so funny I had a question about that negative review I saw on Google the one about Diane providing excuse after excuse to no action the reason I laugh is because we sent this to Diane and so these are some of the things that might happen when we're launching these campaigns quickly dianae obviously didn't mind actually she loved it you actually read the reviews that's impressive but what was really funny is that uh you know we we said you know oh Diane providing excuse after excuse and then they were Overjoyed with receiving this email you actually read the reviews that's impressive so these are the kind of things that we could put together very quickly for you for your free campaign that then we can say okay we're not going to go crazy and we're not going to you know make the a 4-Hour clay table but there's things that we can do to make the campaigns look really good to give us our best shot at getting leads for you off of our test and then there was a email Media Company as well too that I just don't want to uh call out because actually this is working so well that they don't really want me to say their name but um they basically had us AI generate this part and then we AI generated this part as well too so we got all these personality traits for them we could just enter generate any of these personality traits because they have access to so many people that this is just always going to be true no matter who they reach out to and then we said specifically it looks like you're looking to connect with motorcycle enthusi enthusiasts needing protective gear I think we help with that yes I would be interested specifically looks like you're looking to connect with individuals recovering from addiction and re-entering Society I think we could help with that yes I'm busy throughout with Thanksgiving but we'll talk after thanks would love to learn more specifically it looks like you're looking to connect with outdoor enthusiasts seeking durable clothing awesome and so that is what we can launch pretty quickly as long as you just give us the insights of hey if I were to manually research this company this is what I would say and we'll put that together really quickly in our clay tables so maybe I should have started with this from the beginning but who is this or I like to say it's for B2B companies that already have case studies that you can quantify your results and you could say hey we can do this and we have this offer and we have a history of doing it in the past and your customer LTV is above $5,000 if it's $250,000 amazing we find that outbound usually works for companies that are generally have about an LTV of $5,000 it could be a little bit lower but I'd say that's really a an exceptional use case but that's why we invented the test right so that we'd be able to test all these things and so uh really I'd say it's for B2B companies who have case studies already and their customer LTV is around $5,000 or above the higher the better of course for for everyone in this and then what should you expect when we were to do this so I always tell people that there's three problems that you need to solve when you're running an outbound campaign one can we get responses two will these responses book into meetings and then three can you close deals from these meetings this test is only testing number one can we get responses so I've had people in the past who we've run this test for and we almost stopped running this test because the expectations were incorrect we generated I think there was one person from the test we sent 2,000 emails and we literally generated like 35 leads for them and then they came back to us and they said oh you know we don't want to continue because we didn't close any deals from those people which was crazy to us because we got them so many leads and so then it was you know what the heck and so I do want to just set the expectation that outbound does take time I think that whether you work with us as an agency or you work with a different agency you should be able to see responses pretty quickly if you don't see responses pretty quickly I think you need to change up your offer or you need to change up the list that you're targeting pretty drastically uh because there's only so many ways that you could tell somebody that you do bookkeeping services or something like that right you need to make something different and that's usually if somebody doesn't pass this test and then they still want to work with us the reason they still want to work with us is because they want to find that offer that works to cold outbound so then they can Empower their ads and those other things as well too so I very much say that this test is to just see if we could get responses yes boundless Max was able to close revenue from uh this test but that was that message he also sent three months after we did the initial test with them and it just came from those initial domains and that's why I share that that example there and so in this test it's just can we get positive responses and then we'll work with you to uh help you book those meetings and then we will help you uh make sure that the people are qualified enough that you're closing those deals with those meetings as well too and so I'm really excited for this in the uh description below there's a form where you can fill out and apply to have us run a free test we'll review your application we'll review your website and then somebody from my team or myself will reach out about how we could get this started for you generally we're just going to hop on a call talk really quick about your business make sure that all of our expectations are aligned and then we want to jump into launching a campaign for you uh as fast as possible we want to send you about 1,500 to 2,000 leads just to make sure that we get enough volume through the campaign to see if this works and then again this is also just a test to see how we work and then how you work as well too because if you do get leads from the test amazing I hope you want to continue with us and work with us on one of our retainer packages and then if not maybe you still liked the way that we're able to launch campaigns quickly for you and you still want to test and you want to learn and you want to iterate on cold outbound and we'd be happy to help you in that regard as well too so I hope you find this interesting uh if you want us to launch a free campaign for you check out the link in the description I'm going to be talking about this a lot more and I'm really excited to be able to do this for people so uh thanks everyone talk soon\#\# Date Posted:

\# 11 AI Prompts to Automate your Prospecting Research

Date Posted: 2023-03-01

hey everyone in this video we are going to go over 11 prompts that you can use to automate your prospecting research on an account level as well as a person level I've spent probably around the last five hours getting these prompts right making sure we have all the data together for them and I'm extremely excited to show all of this data to you now before we get into it uh this is automating your account research at scale a lot of these still need a couple tweaks but otherwise a lot of them are ready to ship inside of emails immediately and so I'll try to call those things out as we're going through it because I want everyone to get the best information that we can possibly get so we have this list of websites over here that we are constantly looking for and we use clay to be able to enrich the company because a lot of times we're doing the prompting based off of the company description that is from their LinkedIn profile we have another list of leaders at the company which I will potentially blur out uh so that we'd be able to post this in other places and not get it banned but anyway this tool is clay.com which is finding all of this information for us and then we have integrated open AI into the tool to be able to deduct all of the information from here so we have the website and the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to find the mission of the company how could we deduct what is the actual mission of the company so the prompt that we use here is we used the uh open AI prompts here to say what is the mission of the company using this input the input is and then we're using the LinkedIn company description that we found from their LinkedIn company page be specific and use keywords in the description not normally found in other companies keep the output under six words and make the output conversational slash casual complete this prompt I was on your LinkedIn company page and it looks like you're focused on blank and then we get into it and so immediately a couple things that have to get fixed here is I know that sometimes it says I was on your LinkedIn company page and it looks like you're focused on and then it'll have the output and then sometimes it won't have the output easy change I'm not worried about that but if we look at these companies canva on revolutionizing design nailed it calendly streamlining meeting scheduling nailed it Loom work communication with video nailed it bit word and empowering secure collaboration with open source password management nailed it clay.com improved business analytics automation nailed it notion create an inclusive workspace nailed it Salesforce connecting companies and customers for good nailed it all of them nailed it so and then liquid death eliminating plastic with hashtag murder your thirst okay great nailed it uh moving on to the next one let's bring our website so that we can keep them all together here what we are trying to do is we are trying to make a inference about who does this company usually sell to who are the ideal customer profiles that this company usually sells to and so our prompt in this situation was again taking the LinkedIn company description and saying what is the job title that has the this company usually sells to using the input as a guide for what they do the input is this who gets most value out of the product and what does their usual job title give up to three job titles do not include any numbers or extra information just a comma separated list of titles maybe a little bit of over prompting but let's take a look at this canva graphic designer visual designer creative designer nailed it calendly scheduling coordinating meeting coordinator event planner nailed it loom.com product manager excuse me communication manager team leader nailed it notion project management nailed that Salesforce sales again executive nailed at HubSpot customer success sales representative again nailed it Red Bull executive entrepreneur marketer all right that's funny uh lime urban planner transportation management sustainability sustainable Mobility director yeah nailed it okay I don't know about you but we're moving on that was a good one okay so this is a really fun one here as well in this prompt what we did is I used a Google search in order to find the pricing page of the companies it's a really quick what we have here is we were just looking at the website and I wanted to see any of the URLs that mentioned pricing and I wanted to put in the dollar sign and this was in order to find companies at the pricing of the company on the page so the Google snippet would give us the pricing and so see how it gives us the pricing right here and so we can just deduct over here what the pricing is and so in this case we kept it very specific I just wanted I wanted it to tell me the pricing and then I also wanted to know if it was manual or if it was annual uh not and manual if it was monthly or if it was annual pricing so again here is our uh prompt and then these were some of the answers that we got so again canva 12.99 nice Loom 1250 calendly always free yeah that makes sense uh Loom 1250 bit Warden 360 yep clay they got us yep uh notion a little bit of a Miss I'm going to call that out completely here uh Salesforce not totally sure HubSpot this looks pretty correct uh Red Bull and liquid death no pricing pages of course and you know those kinds of things so this is obviously an inference from the the Google page so this data is as good as the data that you give it obviously but still pretty dang good so now let's move to our next one so in our next category what we were doing is we took a look at the job title of the LinkedIn profiles that we found at the company and what we're doing is we were trying to find what is the focus of these job titles and I think there might be a better one in another place ah yes nope never mind so what we did is we took the the job title and we basically said okay hey here's the prompt tell me what the focus of this person's role based on the title name and input be specific and Casual the title name is this the input is this complete this prompt with the tasks they are responsible for and under six words as the title I'd imagine you focus on blank and so we got leading organizing and strategizing directing technical strategy and leading product development creating and leading developing software this was for the CTO I can get you there I think I might have accidentally deleted their titles so I could get that again uh more towards the end of the video but we'll we'll keep this going on anyway I assure you that this one was pretty much nailing everybody's job Focus uh if you put in an accountant there it was going to talk about you know organizing the financials of the business it was very good for what they were focused on the next one that we're going to look at is we are going to summarize a company's news articles or their announcements based off of their domain and so we use the predict leads feature over here and we found all of the relevant news articles about the company and basically we just needed to use the title sometimes the main body of the article was too much data for openai to ingest so we were just using the title of the article instead so we have all of these events and I just took the first event and so we'll see canva launches AI feature calendly hires a CMO notion launches an AI feature bit Warden launches a new product uh Loom launched two new features and let's take a look at the completion uh basically the prompt that I wanted to use was using the input complete my prompt using keywords specific to the news article complement them on their findings of the article keep it very short and Casual make sure to leave out corporate jargon shorten company names when applicable don't make any reference to the time of the article being published the input is the news article complete this prompt I saw the recent news article about and then it goes into it so I saw the recent news article about canva's new AI feature great work about calendly hiring Jessica as a chief marketing officer awesome I saw the recent news article about your launch congrats on the success of new loom features uh congrats on the bit wardens Pat passwordlist.dev beta program uh Notions AI tool being launched and these were obviously blank so this was a little odd this one liquid death receiving serious C funding congrats Red Bull launching Zayn Maloney congrats that's awesome news what is that oh interesting okay yeah it's the F3 competition there so anyway that we have a open AI summarization of what happened in the article keep going now we can also so here what we're doing is we are inferring what is the possible problem that a company is trying to solve by hiring the person that they're trying to hire right and so we have all of these job openings listed by the domains and I only pulled out one of them and so you can see we have account executive CX Advocate accountant head of go to market operations all of these things The Prompt that we gave it is essentially I wanted to be able to say okay hey you're hiring for this position that usually means that the company is trying to do something and so the prompt we have is tell me what problem this company is trying to solve based on the open job that is listed in the input keep it short and be specific based on what that job title is known to be tasked with in a company the input is this which is the job title complete this prompt I saw your company was hiring for a job title in my experience this means you're trying to improve the company's what so let's take a look at some of these remember we got canva calendly and Loom coming up first so I saw your company was hiring for a account executive in my experience this means you're trying to improve the company's International sales and customer relations by finding someone with knowledge of both German and English awesome line what do we got here they're hiring for a full stack engineer and this means that you want to improve the company's technology infrastructure and develop more efficient web applications using python awesome hiring for a CX Advocate what do you want to do with the company you want to improve its customer experience awesome accountant what do you want to do with the company uh make sure the financial accuracy and record keeping is all in good order uh let's see field sales manager Richmond you want to improve the company's sales performance enrichment area you get the idea we nailed it on this one too moving on this is another question that we get asked all the time can we deduct if a company is B2B or b2c and so here we're going to use the LinkedIn company description again I will call out that this one I would say 95 of the time is really right there's a couple times that you might have some misses but this is an inferred uh you know piece of information so it's pretty good and if really I'm calling out Facebook right here calling it out on myself I don't know why I put B2B you could see the prompt and somebody suggests me if there's a better prompt out there so I'm telling it straight up a B2B company is a company that sells to other companies a b2c company is a company that sells to Consumers using the input tell me if the company is likely a B2B company or a b2c company the input is this like I said the LinkedIn company description the only acceptable output is either B2B or b2c do not answer in any other way and as you can see we got canva b2c they're a very prosumer SAS I would take that calendly B2B nailed it Loom B2B nailed it bit Warden B2B notion B2B Salesforce HubSpot B2B liquid death b2c nailed it Red Bull b2c lime b2c nailed it Target b2c Walmart b2c gong.io B2B 100 coaches B2B Forbes B to B sweet green B to C and then we have a couple one so I would even say Forbes is probably more like a B to C but I mean who they sell sell to is they provide services for businesses on advertising dollars maybe the argument could be made for Facebook anyway for the most part it Nails this far better than doing all of the work yourself I would keep it going all right so actually this one has nothing to do with the websites um in clay as the today is January uh 21st 2023 we are going to release next Monday a uh feature where you'll be able to scrape somebody's LinkedIn post either LinkedIn posts based off of a keyword or LinkedIn posts that are the last 10 LinkedIn posts that they have so what I did is I copied and pasted some of those outputs into this table and I basically want to summarize the LinkedIn post and so you'll see my prompt here use the input to complete my prompt in under eight words keep the output short and use specific keywords from the post these are social media posts by other people and I would just like to know the main idea of each post the input is this length post complete this prompt I just wanted to reach out because I saw your post about blank so let's take a look this one is a post I wrote only two percent of LinkedIn users are getting access to a list that are most engaged and the rest are settling this is basically talking about how if you post on LinkedIn you'll start getting people to view your profile and those are the best people to reach out to I just wanted to reach out because I saw your post about linkedin's most engaged prospects awesome uh there are two hard Parts about go to market that become much easier once you've reoriented your thinking I just wanted to reach out because I saw your post about GTM and problem framing awesome customer appreciation should be a daily practice but today get to know your customer's day is an opportunity to go the extra mile okay I saw your post about showing customer appreciation this is actually a post based off of Uber's company page so this works for person pages and Company pages let's see uh career compounding is magical this is just one of the career lessons I found out by sitting down with Uber CEO Dara what was the post about building your career over time this one I was asking people to take 20 seconds and vote for the golden Kitty award for clay what was the post about Clay's golden Kitty nomination you get the idea pretty much we're nailing it again over here all right another problem that I see all the time oh we gotta refresh another problem that I see all the time is people will put crazy things into their titles and so when you put these things into your titles I it's if I use this in an email you know that I took this from your LinkedIn page and I scraped it I didn't actually manually do the research and so what I built was a AI uh prompt to clean these titles so let's take a look at the prompt before we take a look at the results using the input clean the job titles from unimportant information and keep the most important part of the job title oftentimes people list two job titles say things like we're hiring or they put seniorities in weird places clean the input to include the main job title the input and then we just have the titles to be cleaned so let's see growth marketer we're hiring growth marker account executive German and English account executive this one we didn't get it on this one Chief strategy officer and Global uh development officer it kept it the same that's fine this person Management Consultant author professional speaker lean in continuous Improvement Management Consultant professional speaker definitely an improvement from just sending them that title CEO ycw2022 CEO founder and CEO CEO digital marketing coordinator director digital marketing director senior vice president vice president and so you can pause the video and keep looking through all these but again we pretty much nailed it uh again now we what we tried to do with this one and this one didn't work as well I didn't even I'm making a blog post about this and I didn't even include it in the blog post basically I asked AI to read a job description and tell me if the job it pays salary or if it pays hourly for the salary it worked really well and then it seems like the invalid input and the no valid outputs are the hourly ones like if you read it it will have the hourly ones but it uh for some reason it doesn't output it here and so I kind of let that one rest so we will just move on from that one pretty quickly this one is one of my favorites all the time we have a problem of finding out which companies are actually SAS companies because if you are a SAS company that sells to real estate agents you will say on your LinkedIn company page that you are in the real estate industry but you will not tell anybody that you're a SAS company so I built a AI prompt to tell us is this a SAS company or not and this is all based off of their LinkedIn company description so it's not really hard data to find so let's check out the prompt and our prompt is is the company in the input a software as a service company a software as a service oh I even spelled it wrong and it still worked okay software as a service company is a company that offers a software usually for a monthly or annual wow subscription to multiple users providing them with a service the input is this company description only return as a result as true if it is a software as a service company or false if it is not a software as a service company so we're going to save these changes and let's take a look at the results canva true now that calendly true Loom true bit word and candidly I have no clue why it didn't say bit Warden was a SAS company clay true notion true Salesforce true HubSpot true liquid death false excellent Red Bull false lime false excellent Acme Target Walmart ShopRite Falls gong.io true 100 coaches Forbes false excellent uh these next three companies false excellent Xavier nailed it YouTube and Facebook I thought this was one of the most interesting ones they said it was false which is perfect I would not consider YouTube and Facebook a SAS company but it still nailed it so that is awesome and rounding out one of our last ones open AI is also really good at taking unstructured bodies of text and then dropping it into structured bodies of text so what we did is we automated a Google search to find the Glassdoor reviews of a company this is very simple all we did was site glassdoor.com the company name and then I just typed has an overall rating so we can make sure that was inside of the snippet and so see how we have you know canva has an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5\. bit Warden has an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 but see how this isn't in the same place as here so if we were to just try to say if we were to just use a regular expression and say give me the first number in this description well here it's going to get you 4.5 but over here it's going to get you 19\. so we created an open a AI prompt to structure this unstructured data very simple using the input tell me what the company review of the company is only return numerical value no words the input is and then we took the Google snippet and look at this 4.5 4.5 3.9 3.9 3.5 3.5 4.7 4.7 3.6 3.6 you get the picture so if you are a salesperson a Founder a marketer anybody that's trying to do account level research on your prospects and it is taking a lot of time here are 11 AI prompts that you can use in order to shorten that time and a lot of these are ready to go to be start uh using in your outbound messaging I had a lot of fun building this video if you have any questions about this reach out to myself my name is Eric noislowski or you can reach out to the clay team uh also you can join our slack Channel which is clay.com backslash slack where you'd be able to get more information about doing these kinds of things again I really had a lot of fun making this video and I hope you got a lot of value out of it have a great day everyone\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Launching Your First Cold Email Campaign

so in this video I'm going to take a quick pit stop from you know learning anything new and the tutorials and we're going to actually go over how to fully launch a campaign with the least amount of tools possible like we're not going to do anything fancy we're going to keep it super super super simple and um I guess we'll we'll have fun doing it so I uh wanted to show a campaign where we're going to try to invest h no we are going to try to get a meeting with managing directors Prin princi um CEOs investment analysis analysts at Venture Capital firms that want to invest in SAS businesses and so we're going to do a little bit of Apollo filtering and then we will uh you know pull out some people clean up the list load into smart lead and we would be able to launch this campaign so what we need to be able to do with this copywriting we're just doing I saw you were a title at company name and wanted to reach out are you looking to invest in software companies doing 20% month of month month uh growth for the past 14 months at a high level August 22 Revenue was 250k September is 3.2 NPS of 7.9 churn under 12% we're looking to a raise that would help expand the engineering team and double down in growth channels that are already working for us namely outbound and organic content would this be interesting enough to discuss on a zoom sometime and then email 2 we also just raised from H HubSpot and they would be willing to go over their projections for our Venture with you as well and maybe I don't know like we this this could honestly be anything but it's like whatever uh Venture Capital firm you've also raised money from um you want to just use that as social proof so this is a completely fake company there's nothing true in this email this is a complete like makeup but anyway this is how we would launch this campaign so first we're going to open up Apollo we don't need to use the company section at all for this we're going to use the filters here first so the people we're going to be searching for we want to search for investment analyst um and we can actually just do analyst in general because once we do the filters um they don't actually have to have investment in their name it's it's going to be fine and then so investment analyst is like the lowest person on the totem poll we're going to talk to we really want to be talking to the managing directors so then we'll do president principal so see how I'm typing in uh all of these and it's kind of going slow if you use chat gbt to just create a comma separated list of the titles you're looking for you can copy and paste them um into here and so I'm going to put like CEO and then we'll just put managing director and we're going to just be done from there okay cool now we're going to move down and we're going to make the location we're going to make this United States and then employees we don't want them to be well let's see how this shakes out we'll go to Industry and keywords and so here's where we're going to get a little fancy so we're gonna go to venture capital and private Equity right and so now if you were to pull a list of people from if you were to pull this list right they are Venture Capital firms or their private Equity firms but it's not going to be your right fit like right off of here see how it says us Urology Partners you think they're going to want to invest in a SAS company just not going to happen so here's where we're going to get fancy we'll do venture capital and private Equity company keywords and now we'll put SAS technology software whoops hopefully it didn't cut off that E Yeah software technology um okay actually we've got a great list here so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at these keywords and see if I can find any good gold in here we can do B2B B2B let's see if I can find any other good gold that changed my list a little bit you always want to see if like it's actually adding anything see I could use big data but I'm pretty sure every time Big Data is mentioned SAS is going to be mentioned as well so we'll try it though and so we're at 4.4 and let's take it up a notch yeah see it didn't really change it and so let's see early stage where was that early stage let's check this one early stage no well all right let's try let's try early stage investment because I can see why that wouldn't like you wouldn't say software but you'd say early stage investment 4.4 okay not a huge increase let's check these guys Angel investment billionaires who is putting billionaires in uh startup acceleration oh so we could put startup 4.5 okay helped us a little bit but not that much entrepreneurship let's check startup advice startup funding startup online events startup conference startup y okay yeah so we are basically good I I don't think we're going to really be putting in a ton more effort and we're going to get a whole lot of better people out of here so now we'll go to the save category and now what we're going to do is since I've already have these lead saved we can just let it rip from here so we're just going to download all these people um and if we didn't want to download all these people and we wanted a Max per company I don't want to reach out to the whole company we'll put like five right here right and so then we'll put 2300 Max people per company is five and then we'll hit export and so then what we do is oftentimes we're going to come back to this list so I save I you could save the uh the list inside of Apollo they have features for that so you can keep coming back to the the lead list um for me that gets too crazy because then we would have probably like 90 saved lists in Apollo that gets too crazy we use the URL and we save that in our project management tool inside of clickup um you could either save the search inside of Apollo or you could bring the URL someplace else the big thing that we do while this is this is downloading the big thing that we do is before we do anything we create a list and so we'll be like um test yeah so like test for email finding I'll put it there and I'll hit add to lists usually I'll create a new one for the actual list that we're making here though and then I'll put lists here advanced settings exclude and then we'll do test for email finding and now I'll take this URL and I'll save it in our project management tool and then we're done um so the next time we come back to this list we know that we've already reached out to you know the you know we have this list and all of these people are fresh and we can reach out to them um so now let's go to our exports which I guess this is another fun way to like show Apollo CSV exports okay so this is still in progress what's basically going to happen is I'm going to download this list and then I'm going to bring it to debounce for it to get cleaned up for the purposes of this video I'm going to just download another list to just show you how this happens and then we'll we'll take it from there and so but please remember that we are going to download this list from Apollo upload it to debounce debounce is going to verify all of these email addresses and then that is the only time that it's safe to upload it to Smart lead we no before we start any email campaign you have to run it through an email list cleaner no matter what I don't care who you get it from you gota that's just what you have to do so we'll yeah so remember you're just going to clean this list I'm not going to wait for all of these things to happen we're just going to download this one and then we're going to jump into smart lead so I have a new campaign set up so I'm just going to call it test fundraise campaign we have a new campaign set up and so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to import our leads so we'll hit Apollo contact export and import these leads for us okay now we are given these options none of these matter for us in this at this point so we're just going to hit save so now we're able to map our Fields over here what we need to make sure of is that all the fields that we're going to use in our campaign are mapped inside of smart lead so we have the company name mapped the first name and the last name mapped and I need their title so we're going to jump in here and we're going to call this a custom field and it's just going to be title because smartly doesn't have it then we also want to make sure that their website I mean no not their website their email address is in here too and so we'll hit this and we'll hit email so now title company name first name those are the only things that we need so now we'll hit save and next see this number of retail locations we don't actually need this um you could keep it because we're never going to use it but we don't actually need it so we're going to delete it so we'll hit save and next 296 leads were not imported this usually is because they're like blank or something so we'll upload this like blank as far as the CSV file is blank or no actually in Apollo they'll give you blank emails if they don't have an email address so that's probably why so then we will save this and it's great okay blocked email for some reason I have them on my do not contact list now we're going to Stage our campaign so very quickly we're just going to copy and paste our stuff in here so we're going to say investment question then first name title blah blah blah so here's the most important part we're going to type all of this in what we need to make sure is that first name is actually mapped as a custom variable there's nothing more important when you're setting up your campaigns than getting your custom variables correct it would be wildly embarrassing to legitimately send like this like like that to somebody in an email campaign so the way we ensure that it's 100% correct is we just open the bracket and we selected ourselves first name okay so that's exactly how it was title hm that doesn't look like a fit how are we going to do this title there we go company name what does this one look like company name boom now we have that one and now it's all set and I'm going to say thanks for the time Eric great now we're going to add a step and we're going to hit hit email and so I usually wait 3 to 5 days we'll put that in here as well uh one thing if I don't mention it anywhere else in the course this is not a proper signature whenever we're doing signatures you want to do like Eric no lowski founder gruth engine X and then you must include a full business address in the signature in order to be compliant in the United States um that is a must and then you also need to use an unsubscribe so my feeling on unsubscribes and maybe I should do a full module on this is um I I find it crazy that people want unsubscribe links because the first thing that you're told in email is that you should never click a link from an email that you've never gotten before and so I think somebody would be able to take down like Ford Motor Company or apple or like General Motors just by like sending emails that look like sales emails and then just have people click the unsubscribe link and like hack them however that works I don't know so I from a principal standpoint we don't send them as links because no one should be like emailing should be like clicking on these links and so um what we send because you need a way for them to opt out so a clear way to opt out is if you say if this email is not relevant to you just let me know and I won't email you again and so then we like you put that in and like you're still telling them this is how you get off the list right and so I know is kind of a gray area but like I I don't want people to be clicking on like links from emails that they've never gotten that's just crazy to me so anyway now we set up a new step we wait for three days in between and now we have this email over here and so now we're going to copy and paste this in here's a mistake and I'm going to show you what it looks like when we put that in right so we're going to hit save and next then we're going to set up our campaign so we'll pick our sending accounts and I'll just just be like Eric Noah slowski okay great and so these are our sending accounts oh I guess some of them need to warm up forgot about that so these are our sending accounts we'll save these and then we'll hit our campaign schedule New York I like to send every 13 minutes so we can get 41 out um really it's like 11 that gets us like 50 out and we'll put it to like 250 per day tomorrow just so happens be Columbus Day I could sit here and be like all right I want this to launch on Tuesday right hit save save and next this is okay great and so now we can look at our campaign the biggest thing we want to check for is to make sure all of our custom variables are working so what I pop between is like the copyrighting and the final review to make sure everything's working so first name first name title title company name company name name great and then we want to do it for the next one so we look at email to oh look that's blank why is that blank we go back why is it blank oh because this is capital F iir sore but it needs to be lowercase f whoops so we go in and we edit that whoops I got rid of that hit save and next boom and we'll go to email to and now we've got the name so the other thing I just checked for is like to make sure that everything makes sense right so if it's Westlake Pro okay great George George Ken Ken Amar Amar easy who does okay perfect Bill see but there's no bill but it's B Taylor and their last name's Taylor so that makes sense mirav vast mirav vast oh the oeral Charle school I wonder how they qualified for this that's crazy anyway this so this is a problem when you have no other Tech um and you're just using just Apollo is like sometimes these things are going to come up but anyway we'll just keep checking and so then we're good so now all I'd have to do is we've passed the check everything's working we can just hit schedule campaign and we would be able to launch this and so I hope this gives you like a quick overview of how easy it would be to launch campaigns um and we'll show much more complicated stuff later on but see some mistakes that we're going to have in here is like the company names aren't going to be clean the titles might be crazy see how it says you I saw you were a CEO like you got to say the CEO but in clay we usually solve that but there's not really a way to solve that um in smart lead by itself right here the other thing is that school came in right and so if I had like a full Tech stack that we'd be able to use um crunch base has information on what types of companies Venture Capital firms have invested in in the past and we would use that filter inside of crunch base to say like I want people who have invested in SAS in the past grab that company list upload that list to Apollo find the contacts and then use clay to like fix all of the the stuff here but at a high level this is how you would be able to launch a campaign um and just get something going um and then we'll work on much more advanced stuff so congrats like we got through basically the first big part of of the course you can Now launch your own campaign\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# Overview of My Favorite B2B Data Sources

hey everyone in this video I'm gonna go over a workflow that we use to basically get all of our data for the agency and it really comes down to only a couple of sites that you really need to be able to get to uh you know your data and so this is a general walkthrough of what we do we use clay literally for everything like everything feeds into clay and we do all of our enrichment and cleaning in there but usually we'll find different sources to to start with and so in this video we're going to go over a lot of those sources when do we go to those sources when do we not go to those sources you know and we'll talk about a lot of that and so I'll show off some of the tools and we'll just show how we're doing things and so the first thing I would want to just point out is just Clay is just one of the biggest tools that we use in in general the data enrichments that we can get in Clay is crazy you can look at all the providers here and just see all of the amazing extra providers that you could get from them and it's you know absolutely incredible of of what you can do I basically have dedicated this whole channel to Clay and my work with them so if you want to see all the things that you could do in clay you know go for it it's in my other videos that there's absolutely amazing things that you can do the other main way that we build lists is a classic one uh we just use Apollo and you know in Apollo they just make it so easy to just Source lists um I would say things that we're always using is like job titles and then I love how if you go into company and then include exclude list of companies you could upload a list of domains here and then if you were to go to companies if you just had company names you could import from CSV a list of company names import them into your list over here and then you would be able to uh get the domains and all this stuff so Apollo is a really great search Tool uh for those kinds of cases and then we also use sales Navigator and so the times that we use Apollo versus the time that we need sales Navigator is you know if we're just doing a quick search of you know I just want every CEO of companies in the financial services industry with one to ten employees that's super easy we'll usually just do that inside of Apollo their data is good enough and we'll just take it from there we use sales Navigator if we need more custom things so one the industries inside of sales Navigator are a lot better and then two there's a lot of like intent signals that you can get inside of sales Navigator like change jobs in the last 90 days uh post it on LinkedIn in 30 days and things like that um and then you could do Boolean searches on the keywords inside of sales Navigator and so that's a big thing that we will use and sometimes when we need Super up-to-date contact data we'll be using that as well and so to make grabbing data from sales Navigator much easier we use two tools in particular the first one is Phantom Buster which is really really easy whoops uh we'll just look at so you could do a LinkedIn search export I think it would actually be called a sales Navigator search export where uh you would search you would use this Phantom and then it would pull all of the contacts that are a part of a sales Navigator search that you've created this does use your account uh to uh scrape sales Navigator though um so I always recommend this company called lead hype the domain is tool.leadhype.com they use uh their own accounts to access sales Navigators so you could create a search you can't use any of these things in the workflow part because it's not your profile that they're going to be scraping from but you could use all the rest of the searches and then you can send data uh you could send the links to them and then they'll output all of the data for you and then I'm just going to sign in real quick they also do a lot of good local US business searching so if you're looking for local businesses like Pest Control uh then you can just put in the locations I'll just put in you know New York and then you could launch this and you know you could go look for a local USA businesses as well and so uh to just kind of round this out Apollo we use for when we're doing super easy lists of just things that are stock within their filters sales Navigator we use when we need to do like a very very up-to-date search um or we need to do you know we just need to use one of these filters inside of sales Navigator as well sometimes we'll be scraping LinkedIn groups and that really does a lot of help as well and then we do all of our data enrichment inside of clay and this tool is definitely going to come up more inside of this video and so the next tool that I would want to just go to is crunchbase we use crunch base all of the time to get fundraising like accurate fundraising information but they also have phenomenal industry information as well and so if we ever need anything where you know we need to know hey you know we want to look for anybody who has a company that had just been acquired and you know we want to know who the CEOs of those acquired companies are crunchbase is our go-to tool for things like that um then their industry stuff is really good like you know you have artificial intelligence here like I could put in SAS SAS is a really tough one to get because you know most companies don't identify themselves as SAS and so this is just the the SAS companies that uh are indexed by crunchbase and you've got a really good industry filter over here the other really great part about crunchbase is you could use their partner filters which then you can get topics of interest you can get web traffic you could get Tech in the company by G2 stack and you could just get like G2 stack is really expensive to get access to built with is like 400 a month bombora is a couple hundred or a thousand dollars a month and so crunchbase also gives you access to these other intent providers that are really really good and I like to to use those for that as well um so to round this one out crunchbase is really good if we're looking for investors we're looking for people who recently raised money we're looking for people who have recently had their business acquired or were looking for businesses that have acquired other businesses and then we didn't even get into it their query Builder search is crazy of what you're able to generate over here if if it ever loads in time and so then you can do tons and tons and tons of filters inside of crunchbase and so we talked a little bit about local businesses when we were talking about lead hype uh we also could do a lot of local business scraping using D7 lead finder now the biggest drawback with using D7 lead finder is it works well to find you know see have somebody looked up credit card merchants or house washing or restaurants in Los Angeles but it won't give you a lot of decision maker contact information so we'll usually pair D7 lead finder up with clay and um use that to find the decision maker data really really well so if you're ever looking for businesses that have a low LinkedIn presence D7 lead finder is really really great for this while we're also on the topic of local businesses uh you could use the Google Maps search inside of clay which is also really good because any company that doesn't have a good LinkedIn presence like they have a great Google Maps presence so you think about it you know plumbers don't have a great LinkedIn presence but I wouldn't even want to reach out to a plumber that doesn't have a Google Maps presence because it's probably not even worth selling to them right and so um when it comes to local businesses our go-to is really uh lead hype D7 and then the Google Maps search inside of clay now the other company that I would want to just call out is called built with and this company is really really good for getting lists of companies that are using specific Technologies so somebody just came to me today and they said hey you know I want a list of people who are using retention.com as a technology and so you could just go into builds with and you could just search retention.com as a technology not really sure if that worked you could search retention.com as a technology and you could and you can get a report of all 885 uh websites that are using retention.com and so uh this is really really great for building lists of people that automatically qualify for something so if you're looking for e-commerce Brands uh you can get e-commerce Brands by uh putting in Shopify and then you can get all of the companies in the world that are using Shopify and so there's over six million companies that are using Shopify download this lead list and then you know now you've got a good list of e-commerce companies which is usually more difficult to find uh in other situations other ways that you could find e-commerce companies is with a company called store leads I think it's dot IO oh let's see here at storelease.app so store leads is the platform that you can get a lot of e-commerce data on and then another one you can get e-commerce data on it's called brand nav and so then this one gives you a lot of e-commerce or DTC leads that one's really good as well and so um the other thing that you can do with built with is we've had customers in the past who really want to sell to coaches and consultants and so coaches and Consultants uh oftentimes use tools like kajabi teachable thinkific and things like that and so um built with again is really really great for finding this stuff um so then you could find everybody who's using kajabi and then you can figure out what kind of coaching consultant you want to look for by their keywords and so the way that built with works is if the company installs the technology on their website built with Will detect it if they don't install the technology on their website it's very hard for biltwith to detect it so for instance QuickBooks QuickBooks people do not usually install QuickBooks onto their site and so uh the other one is like HubSpot yes you can find a lot of companies that are using HubSpot in build with but think about how many companies use HubSpot as a CRM and they never connect it with their website so it's going to have a lot of missing data over here another great way that you can get Technologies is by looking at companies job descriptions and so whether you scrape job descriptions yourself or you use a function inside of clay called um oh predict leads hold on we'll go to that provider and then you can look at all of the uh past uh job descriptions and find Tech stack in there and so to kind of just round out the tech stack targeting we basically use built with for most of our data searches and then if they don't install those Technologies onto the website we'll use predict leads and we'll find you know people who are using QuickBooks and they mention QuickBooks in their job descriptions because they're saying oh you know you're going to have to be proficient in QuickBooks and things like that so at this point in the video we've gone over how we do a lot of our basic searching is in sales Navigator and Apollo we do all of our enrichment inside of clay we do some custom searches on intent signals and custom Industries like SAS inside of crunchbase and then our local lead finding is with Clay's Google Map D7 lead finder or the local USA businesses inside of lead hype lead hype also helps us scrape sales navigator at scale Phantom Buster can do the same but it might put your LinkedIn account at risk and so the last one that I want to touch on or actually there's a couple more that I want to touch on that are pretty easy to use if you ever want social data like I want email addresses from Instagram influencers or I want email addresses from YouTube influencers or Facebook or Twitter or Tick Tock this company called socialreach they do it all for you the Founder's name is Sam he's excellent to work with um he has all this data and I found it to be really really robust I just put in a request to him and he gets it for us and he's super awesome about that and so anytime we need social data we go straight to Sam at socialreach for that and so another I'm just looking at my notes over here another company I would want to just point out is called owler.com they have what I like about aller.com is they have really really good uh they call it sectors but it's just like industry targeting and um oftentimes like if you wanted to get a transportation warehousing and Logistics list like that could be really tough to get say we have software internet and computer services we can click on that and then see how we have sub sectors in here so we could just click on the sub sectors and then we can look at all these things look we have these sales enablement softwares we have SAS companies with email Services we have Enterprise software we have file sharing we have big data we have blockchain this is another great one that if you're looking for a very specific company um Targets this is really really great they have Revenue data which is really hard to come by um and then we've got an employee headcount they've got some competitor data as well and then you know you've got your more filters in here of like leadership hires and Acquisitions and and different things like that so I would just want to call out Aller another one I would want to call out is harmonic.ai harmonic has amazing filters um my favorite filter is probably their sector filter for B2B SAS it's absolutely phenomenal to just click this button and just get a list of B2B SAS companies because we use this all the time and uh so yeah they have 9.8 companies 9.8 million companies in their database which is really really robust they have excellent excellent fundraising data and so we most often use this data for when we need like a super super specific search where we're looking for keywords in their description and we're looking for like you know their customer type is B2B and I want certain industry tags and something like this harmonic is a great go-to uh for this kind of data and so then let's see I'm just looking at anything else so these I would I would call all of these mainly retail databases crunchbase Apollo clay sales Navigator D7 lead finder hour harmonic these you could just go to and you could just do a search now if you need to do anything custom though you might need to take it into your own hands to do scraping because essentially all these companies they're just scraping companies essentially is is what they're doing and so if you need to take it into your own hands I always say that Phantom Buster is kind of like the I don't know the like the gateway drug of \[Music\] um the gateway drug of scraping you could check out all of these Phantoms that they have that you could scrape things for yourself and and do things like that they have a Google Maps search export they've got Instagram stuff they've got LinkedIn stuff you know I always check Phantom Buster first to see if they have anything one that's a little bit more technical is called appify and you could look at their store and they have all of these actors in here like if you want um open job data they have an indeed scraper in here where you can use this to scrape open jobs on indeed and um yeah and then just get that that data plug it into Apollo or clay and find the contact data and then you can take it from there and so appify is also one of our go-to's if we need something very specific um you know like a Twitter script I don't know like there's just tons of stuff in here they have over 1300 so you can just take a look and just see what's on there um speaking about scraping things yourself there's two main ways that we scrape things for ourselves custom and so the first way is this little Pokeball over here this is a Chrome extension called instant data scraper and so this tool automatically Maps things really really well and scrapes the website from it so this is a company called clutch and so if you're ever looking for agencies to Target Fletch is where to go for agencies so if you want to Target marketing agencies or web development agencies or mobile app agencies a lot of them are on clutch and it's super easy to just come in here and find them and so if we were to look for e-commerce I guess this would be e-commerce agencies oh Ecommerce developers great so there's 20 000 firms all we would have to do is just go to instant data scraper and then say all I want is the company name and I want the website then we would just go here in instant data scraper and see we have the website in here uh it we could just click start crawling and it's just going to go through and it's going to grab all of the data for us so if we ever need to do anything custom Phantom Buster appify or instant data scraper are one of the first things that we go to so then instant data scraper could scrape all this stuff in we'd be good to go now what if we are searching for data and we have data here and then we want to click into this page here and then I want to grab you know most common project size or something uh from here or something else like maybe I want to grab the reviews or something like that so this this is called scraping into something or doing a click in and so the easiest tool that I've found which I it might not seem like it's the easiest tool in the world is a tool called scrape storm it's actually a application that you download onto your computer and so what I found is super easy about it is you just open it up you just put in the link that you need and then it auto automatically Maps everything that you want to scrape and then you're able to click into items and grab them so see it's Auto detecting all of these fields literally we just set it up then we could just like click onto this title link which is the link right here it puts it into a box of what you're looking at so see how it put that into a box then we can hit scrape in it's going to show me scrape in here and then all that I need to do is just click add a field and remember there's something specific that I wanted I wanted the reviews so then you click add field click this and then you have this field in here you would just click Start and it would just start scraping all that information and you could customize it with adding a field and you know swapping back and forth between all of these things um and so scrape storm is another great tool that we use as well um and then I would say another thing that we use a ton is like Google search scraping and so a lot of people don't know about these things called Google search operators but Google search operators make your searches a whole lot better and so let's say you want to search for people on Instagram who are real estate agents and they mention their email so if we were to put Instagram site Instagram oh I've actually done this already um real estate agent and Gmail or Hotmail or Yahoo blah blah actually we're going to do this one because we're searching for them to be in New Jersey we can grab this here and we could find all of these people and so um there's ways that you could scrape all of this data I think even they're letting you add things to Google Sheets now inside of clay we could just copy and paste this search and then we could hit import data and then we could just use the Google search function to just put that in number of results and then hit submit and then this is basically where like then it would just load this Google Search so instead of us trying to figure out some way to scrape Google ourselves we just do it inside of clay it gets us all the data that we need over here and then we're we're good to go and so um yeah just a kind of a quick wrap up on on this section if you will is when you're trying to get more custom data Phantom Buster gives you access to a lot of um you know easy to use scrapers and they're already built appify does the same but it's a little bit more technical on how to use and then if you need to use it yourself instant data scraper is a great Chrome extension to get started on and then if you need something more advanced scrape storm would be able to pull that information for you and so um this is an overview of basically all of the tools that we use and I would say that you know sales Navigator like I said sales Navigator clay and Apollo we use more than anything else crunchbase we're basically using for those industry targets and those intense signals you have your local businesses over here with D7 and Lead hype Phantom Buster and amplify come with pre-loaded custom scrapers then I just use clutch because this is a great place to get agency data but then you could also scrape it with instant data scraper and you could click in even better has great industry data as well harmonic has great industry data and then you could also use Google to scrape things too and so I hope that this video was useful to you as kind of just maybe it gave you a couple of companies to go to maybe it inspired some other things but um yeah this is basically what all of them come down to and and what we use inside the agency\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# How Sales People Should be using AI in 2023

hey everyone in this video I'm gonna share some of my insights about what I have learned so far messing around with the chat GPT specifically 3.5 uh and gpt4 in sales prospecting use cases and so I'm just going to share a couple insights of how we should start thinking about how to use artificial intelligence and sales prospecting and then I'm going to show some examples of how you could use artificial intelligence and so the biggest thing that I want to cover is in my opinion there are three major use cases to use artificial intelligence in sales prospecting the first one is to clean and categorize unstructured data so what I mean by this is if you have a data set that is pretty messy and you can all you need is to pull one's Insight out of that data set and then bring it into another column or bring it into another more usable format artificial intelligence is great at doing this when a regular expression won't work or when just splitting columns aren't going to work because they're not all by the same keyword or something it does a really good job of doing that the Second Use case is to summarize or infer decisions from inputs and so using somebody's LinkedIn summary recent news about a company um you know there are LinkedIn posts uh some of those kinds of things are um a phenomenal use case inside of clay using artificial intelligence because now we can create these custom Snippets which we're going to get into and the third major use case is creating a full email to reach out to prospects using artificial intelligence and my recommendation the reason I mention this is because I see a lot of people trying to do this and while this is a use case for GPT I actually do not recommend anybody who does this and the reason why is because when you do this artificial intelligence starts having too much variance in the output that it's going to deliver and there's just two you just lose control over the entire process and so when you think about well what am I actually trying to customize for what you're actually trying to customize for is that unique Insight that you want to bring to that Prospect at scale and that can usually be accomplished in Under 12 words you don't need to change your email completely in order to to get that across and so I don't recommend anybody creates full emails to reach out to prospects with inside of chatgpt I am a big fan of just using Snippets and bringing those insights into the Snippets um the next thing I would just want to cover is the difference between chat GPT 3.5 and gpt4 you know in my experience the difference between gpd3 uh The DaVinci model versus uh 3.5 turbo um 3.5 turbo or chat gbt is I would say I don't know 10 times better than the gpt3 with the DaVinci model and what also makes it amazing is the the fact that you can converse with chat GPT and in that way you can give it inputs and then you could show it hey here's what I want an output to look like and then you can give it another input and then it'll output uh data the way that you wanted it to and so that is a huge win for being able to stipulate the way that you want your data to actually be outputted now don't get me wrong gpt4 is very very exciting um and it's definitely better than chatgpt or if you want to call it 3.5 turbo um it is definitely better than you uh than those but for the extra cost and the uh you know running it and possibly having some down times because of the apis and everything honestly I don't see a huge difference when I'm using really good prompts in 3.5 with a lot of good examples and then when I'm using gpt4 as well gpt4 is more creative it does come up with a little bit better ideas and has better inferences but I honestly find that 3.5 is just as good um and so moving on from there I just wanted to cover how we should be thinking about conversing with chat gbt we're going to show this inside of clay but it's very much uh similar to the way if you're using the product you just use the the product and you just interface with it um and we're just going to take like a little break inside of clay from that document but so when you're conversing with Chachi BT what you want to be able to do is you want to be able to say okay I'm going to have four messages back and forth and so you're going to have a choice between the system the user and the assistant the system this is just the context that you're giving for the message and so you're saying oh I want you to be an assistant who's going to help me write a sales email you could also change this and say hey uh you are Dwayne The Rock Johnson trying to sell clay or your joint or you're like Conor McGregor trying to sell Salesforce right you could give it its context here of what character it should be playing I haven't seen it change the outputs too much but I just use the system to keep everything easy then you would come down and I would always start off with the user because when you jump into chat GPT you're the first one who starts the conversation so then we would start with user imagine when you're interfacing with chat GPT user is you whatever you're typing in that's what you're getting now the best part about the way that we have this set up is then you can have the assistant and you could stipulate okay when I give you this input I want you to give me this output and that is a really powerful upgrade for the way that we can interface with artificial intelligence and generative text in general so a lot of people ask uh should I be using gpt3 should I be using complete prompt all of these things honestly I think everything you could just switch over to converse with chat gbt chatgpt is amazing uh if you're using the API you've seen the big differences I move I've moved everything into Chachi PT now so let's go back to the dock and so here are some examples that we're going to be going over uh and I'm going to show the prompts in the way that I use it so the first example will be personalize an icebreaker about a company based on a company description we're going to clean some job titles we're going to infer along how long someone has experience in a role we're going to make some decisions about some data sets we're going to create ideas of how a prospect could use our product or service in their company uh Paul news for when a company was for when a person was working at an organization in their past history and asked if they were there or a part of the news infer what a person's focus is from their job title and for why a company would be looking to hire a role and how that affects their company mission and some other things and without further Ado let's jump into the prompts and see how we do it um okay so the first one is we're going to be creating a line the first line for an email basically saying I was on your website and it looks like you helped resolve every alert and stop reaches so basically this is for a company called critical start which is this is exactly what they do so the way that we set this up is we just had two messages and we said you're an A A you're an assistant helping me write the first line to a sales email and then just the user and then this is just very very easy using the input finish the sentence about what a company does this is the input and then we put the company description here complete my sentence in under eight words and use keywords from the input complete each prompt using my prefix here I was on your website it looks like you help pretty easy stuff this is a classic example of the way that I'm doing a lot of my prompts right now and so I'm going to break this down piece by piece and you'll see how we keep using this later on in the video and so if I have an input from an outside Source I always give it the context up front and I say using the input do something right I always say that and then I'll stipulate to it and I'll say this is the input and I put that in quotes so I'm making it very very obvious that this is the input after if I've established what the input is I give it the context of what I want it to do I want it to complete my sentence in under eight words and use keywords from the input basically I want it to be short I don't want it to go crazy and write you know a 10 paragraph essay off of this and I want it to use keywords from the input because if it only has eight words I want it to be very particular about the words that it's actually using and then here we're saying complete each prompts using my prefix here I was on your website it looks like you help this is how I keep control over the prompt so I know exactly what it's going to start with and then because I gave it this context I basically know what it's going to end with as well um and so let's see yeah so I always am basically stipulating an input stipulating the output of what I want it to look like and then stipulating what the prefix is so that I'm always in control of these things then for the Stop sequence I only used it on this one I put a period as a stop sequence and I do that here because I'm basically saying anytime you're about to generate a period stop and so that's how I definitely keep this line under one sentence because if it feels like it's about to generate a period then it just stops everything and it doesn't keep running over when I do my email sequencing I just put a period at the end and we're good to go and that's how I ensure that we're only writing one line about these things so that's how we write a first line on the company Mission another way that I use chat GPT is to normalize people's job titles if you were to reach out to this person and say hey vasu notice that you're the CEO founder of term Tegrity um they would know that that data is scrapes that that isn't a very good look same thing here hey Sam notice that you're the CEO co-founder of via Labs just it really doesn't look good um because you obviously took it from their LinkedIn profile so here we can see that we've normalized yeah let's just move this over we've normalized these titles so that we can use these titles when we reach out to people and so this is a good example of stipulating data for when I want that data so I had four messages so we're obviously going to stipulate something so I had I just gave it context at first then I said as a user clean these job titles and make them shorter and to the point and then I just gave it a bunch of examples that need to be cleaned and these I just came from the top of my head I could probably improve them more if I'd like and then for content for message three I fixed all of the titles the way that I wanted the titles to be fixed um so then I just stipulated to it exactly the way I want everything to look and then basically clean this job title and make them shorter and to the point did it again and now we have all these job titles normalized very very simple but this could really increase the chance of prospects replying if you want to use their job title in the output this one is a lot of fun and so what we're doing here is remember how I said we can use chatgpt to make inferences based off of data sets this is a really good one for that and so basically what I am trying to figure out is I want to know who has been in their company for two years and then they switched companies so basically I'm looking for somebody who uh they were at a company for two years and then they left and then they're at another company for two years and then they left and then they read another company for two years and then they left and so I'm giving it all of these people's start dates and then I it's outputting for me how many of those start dates so their past experiences how many of those were just a two-year Sprint before they moved on to the next one and so I said using the start and end today inputs go line by line and tell me if any of these dates are within two years of each other the output should be how many dates are between two years of each other the inputs are in you know this format if an input is empty just ignore it and keep analyzing and so this is just sample data right and so then all four of them are within two years of each other yeah that's true all four of them are within four years of each other and then this is just more sample data again just training it and teaching it the way that I want so this one this one this one and this one oh maybe it was four whoops I changed this just for the video but it was for whoops um so all four of these again were there and then we could just hit save changes and you can see from all these people's experiences we have uh you know this person was in a role three times in their past four experiences that lasted for two years and then they bounced to another company in the last four experiences of this person they have never just been at a company for two years and then bounced on to the next experience again this person did this person didn't really this person didn't really and and so on and so forth so you could give it a lot of data and just instead of manually looking at data you could have it make decisions which is absolutely phenomenal this is one of my favorite I think every company in the world should be looking at how they can use artificial intelligence to be able to do this um what we're doing here is we're essentially giving people ideas of how they would be able to use clay at their company and so what I mean by this is if you basically I'm taking a company description and then I'm giving a description about what clay does and then I'm saying Hey give them ideas about the way that they would be able to use the product if they were to start using the product right and so our prompts look like this and this is a very long prompt well mostly because we have the the description here but we're saying help me create uh creative ideas about how a company could use my product at their company the input I will give you will be the company description of the company create three ideas about how they could use my product my product is a sales automation tool that helps people build much better lists they can unify all of their data enrichments in one place and send better outbound messages which this can um obviously be improved the company description that I want to sell to is here and then we give them the company description boom boom this is gong right and then we finish up create three outbound campaign ideas for them and make sure to mention the types of job titles we would reach out to you and why we'd reach out to them be creative with the ideas but keep them under 12 words each so then I just gave it some ideas so that I could just show it hey this is what I want the ideas to look like and then we gave it a full company description and then we just let it rip and so we see here Target it manager seeking MDR Solutions improve alert uh resolution with automation reach out to csos of growing firms streamline detection and response processes and all of these things right and we can review some of these but they're basically saying like hey this is our product here's how you could use our product at your company because I looked you guys up one of my favorite ones to happen right now that I might even turn just that one into a video because that one's absolutely fantastic this one is a lot of fun what we did is we pulled their last uh we pulled from their past experience so their second or third experience I pulled a news story about their third experience company and basically did two things I summarized uh what the news story was about and I pulled in their company that they used to work for as well and so the way that we did this is we just basically said using the input summarize the news headline and complete my sentence with it this is the input keep the output under 10 words and use specific keywords from the input complete each output with my prefix notice you used to work at this company Were You There When blah blah so I noticed you used to work a critical start Were You There When MDR service launched for cortex uh oxium notice she used to work at surply Were You There When bootstrap Labs partnered with M particle Incorporated notice you used to work at the Business Council Were You There When joint Pavilion launched Rising Star class I think there's a really interesting one to be able to reach out to people and give some Nostalgia based on uh corporate events at their past companies as well and this one was also fun because we were doing two things in one this one is just very simple we were just uh inferring what people do based on their job title and what they find is important this could really be used as an input for something else later down the line so using the input helped me understand quickly what this person's responsibilities are within a company this is the input in under eight words explain to me what problems they may be facing in their role again down the line this could be uh interesting I would probably feed this into another chat CPT input to basically say okay this is these are the things that this person is concerned about in their company How Could my software help them uh in their company accomplish these goals so then we could do another inference thing um and then over here this one's a lot of fun too um what I did is I found these companies and what jobs that they're hiring for and then I basically made a AI generated line about hey I noticed you're hiring for this role and I and I would imagine you're hiring for this role because you want to improve X within the company so you can accomplish your mission the way we did this was using the two inputs to help me infer why a company would be hiring a person and put one as the company description input two is the open job role they are hiring for I just gave it to them write one sentence using keywords from input one about how hiring this person would help the company accomplish their mission keep the output under eight words complete my sentence using the prefix and all the stuff I saw in your job board that you're hiring for job title I'd imagine you're looking for someone to I'd imagine you're looking for someone to boost MDR Services adoption and awareness and that's for a director of growth marketing awesome awesome line uh virtual care manager I guess we would have to oh whoops we would just have to do a different run on that I saw your job board that you're hiring for an engineer in Chicago Illinois remote I'd imagine you're looking for someone to enhance media flies Tech platforms for sales teams awesome nope we won't read that one I saw on your job that you're hiring for a speech and natural language processing research engineer we should probably normalize these titles as well um I'd imagine you're looking for someone to enhance personalized adaptive learning experiences so when you're reaching out to these people about and saying oh hey like you're hiring for this job you could use artificial intelligence to say hey I bet you're hiring for this job because you're trying to accomplish something um and yeah so this is a lot of what I've been working on mainly I wanted to show this video so that you can learn how to structure your prompts a little bit better and how you think about artificial intelligence I think every campaign has an artificial intelligence input that you should be using and you just have to connect the dots on how well can you say okay I know what your problem is I did the research on your company and I can prove it and here's how we solve those problems is the the framework that I come to with all these things so yeah\#\# Date Posted: 2024-02-29

\# Staffing And Recruiting Business Development Outbound Cold Email Playbook

in this video we're going to go over my Staffing and recruiting Playbook now uh for staffers and recruiters who might be watching this video this is specifically for business development Outreach I know there's a whole other world of of um sourcing that you get into this is not going to cover that in my opinion that's kind of a solved problem business development is what we're going to be covering here and so what I found working with Staffing and recruiting companies is the these are kind of the top three playbooks that we've used and we're going to talk about each of them and how we set all of them up so the most obvious one and the reason why it is so difficult to get a positive response for Staffing and recruiting is the open jobs Playbook this is basically what every recruiting company is using and I think we have a best-in-class take on how to do the open jobs Playbook but basically everyone is is running this play and uh this makes it so that there's a lot of people reaching out to these people like these CEOs when they're hiring for a role and it gets kind of tough traction metrics this is uh more of a general take to just think about data um so instead of looking for companies with open jobs you want to try to get them before they post that job and when they're thinking about posting that job so traction metrics is anything in your industry that shows that they are successful and they you know need to probably increase hiring and uh we won't talk about that in the nitty-gritty tactical workflow too much because it really depends on your industry in order to find traction at these companies but we'll go over a couple of ideas and then the third one which is kind of the newest one that I've been working on is finding employees that have left the company and then saying oh hey you know like Bob just left the company do you are you looking to replace them uh just now like we can help you replace them and so this is probably like the least used Playbook I've never seen another recruiting company use this Playbook at scale um in a really automated way uh but it's not like as Flagship as the open jobs and so when you're doing open jobs Clay is of course a tool that you can use what I would suggest also is checking out app ay.com um they have an indeed scraper and the indeed scraper can scrape indeed for exactly what you're searching for and you'd be able to enrich the the criteria for here so you'd get the job title and you'd get the company name and so the only bad part about getting the company name is you don't get the company website which is a little bit tough and so you can use tools like clearbit or or Apollo in order to turn the company name into a uh website because that's usually I tell everybody if you have a website you can you know if you have a website you can find people and if you have a LinkedIn profile you can find people but without that it's a little bit tough and so you can use the indeed scraper and extract the data and then pull it into clay we're on our last example and you can pull it into clay or you could just use clay uh straight away so there's the fine jobs from LinkedIn data right here and this is what we're going to be working off of for you know our criteria here so we'll just put in like sales we're going to keep it super super General we'll put United States and then what we want to do is oh so we want to say has no recruiter so we'll hit preview jobs and maybe I should have limited the results actually so it doesn't get so crazy so we have 342,000 jobs available in the United States which totally makes sense so we'll just import this and uh so my favorite way to run an open jobs Playbook and why I think it's like the best in class is so I always work backwards from what is the the message that I would send if I were to manually send a message right and so what we would do here is we're going to enrich this for the job description and then so we're going to put LinkedIn again and then we'll get the company identifier no and then the job title keywords is exactly what we have inside of the table okay cool now we're going to run this and what we specifically want is we want the job description so now we'll let this run just letting it run now that we have some jobs coming in what we're going to do is we're going to use AI to basically pull out why they want to like if they were to hire somebody what is the qualities of this person in order for them to be successful in the role and so we're going to so basically what we want to be able to say is so you're hiring for a commercial sales manager I imagine like from reading the job description it looks like you need somebody who's capable of being blah blah blah because the job description said blah blah blah and so we're going to hit say using the input create an inference whoops about what it would take in order for the person to be successful in this role this is the job description and now we're just going to like really make it obvious that this is the job description consider the most important quality the applicant must possess oh whoops in order to fulfill this job then quote in the job description where you made that inference from so uh now what this is basically going to say it's like oh if you're hiring a commercial sales manager it seems like uh it would be important that they are on time because the job description said that they wanted them to be punctual sometimes though AI is going to say the thing and then it's going to requote the thing so it might accidentally say oh this commercial sales manager it's important for them to be on time because the job description says that they need to be on time so we need to tell it not to do that so we're going to say output the inference in a sentence that is under 20 words and looks like this and so then again we'll be super we're going to put a lot of quotes to show it I saw that in order for the commercial sales manager to be successful you need someone who is on time because the description said an employee uh this person must be fual and then we're just going to put that there and then we'll go boom boom boom when creating your inference do not use the same words as what is in the job description to make the quote so it looks human follow my format in the example every time so candidly I'm trying to get this video done so that people would be able to get this done pretty simply um we would probably give it more examples down here where I'd copy and paste this and then I would give it an example and then I'd manually write like two so that it was it's like really on point for what we want but I'm just going to let this run and so then if there's any yeah okay so for the most part we nailed it maybe I didn't even need examples okay so in order for the sales consultant to be successful great so you need to someone with strong customer service skills because description passion for technology and exceptional customer service great so now you'd be able to lead off with your email basically showing that you've done research about what it would take for this person to be successful and then you could say I've got a couple client like a couple people like would you want to take a look at them and and all those things in my opinion there's not a whole lot of ways to improve this Playbook but this is the best way in my opinion to improve this Playbook where you're basically showing that you read the job description um and you know like being able to reach out to them and say like oh it looks like you're you're searching for this person another thing you could do is you could enrich the company and you could find what the mission of the company is and then you could use AI to be like oh like it seems like you're hiring for a commercial sales manager um at this point uh so that the company and then you talk about what the mission of the company is and why they're probably hiring looking to hire this person um one thing we've done in the past too is we've like scraped other people who hold positions similar to this and then say something this we only do this in followup emails but say something cheeky like oh if you could multiply John on your team Jake on your team or Stephanie on the team which one of them would you want us to find more people like that so then it's also like a level of personalization where then they're also like okay they did their homework you know this is obviously recruiting email so there's like this is the base of the play but then there's like creative ways that you can go in and out of the Playbook as well uh I'm trying to think of anything else to mention too um you could also call out the most recently hired people and say like oh I saw you're looking for a commercial sales manager um you know I assume the team is growing because you brought on you know you you brought on Robert and you brought on Tiffany and you know like you want to hire more people just like them you know how can we help there's a lot of different ways that you can spice this message up with with more you know criteria so then uh traction metrics I'm just going to speak about this a little bit briefly there are some traction metrics that just let you know that a company is moving in the right direction so website traffic is pretty good um although website traffic is really um not not amazing amazingly accurate what you want to do is you want to go to like similar web and you could scrape similar web um you could use cagent to do this or there's other platforms um like appify that I was showing before that can scrape similar web and so you're looking specifically for there's a three-month traction metric yeah so see how it's been pretty flat for Noble project this entire time so what we'd be looking for is somebody who's gotten a spike in three-month traffic and then that's some traction employee headcount growth is a form of traction opening up a new office is a form of traction recently receiving fundraising is a form of traction um their social media Pages gaining a lot of followers is another form of traction so these are kind of different ways that we would split everything up and say okay we don't know that they're hiring right now but here's some traction that we could be searching for in order to know that they're they're hiring so you know we could have all of that also the fact that they just recently installed an ATS you can use builtwith to do this so if they just recently installed Greenhouse or lever two months ago you know that they're starting to take uh recruiting pretty seriously another thing that I think we should just go over is you also want to see like if they have an internal recruiter at all and so I would use I would use headcount for this and so we would do find employee headcount by job title and then we'd map the uh let's see the company URL and then I just want to look for do they have a recruiter on their team do they have human resources on their team and uh what else recruiter maybe they'd call them a sorcerer it's not really going to happen but and you want to know if they have these people on the team because with these people on the team they'd be able to like if they have these people then they're probably all set but if they don't have these people then that's another good Outreach that you could be doing so we also score these companies when we're reaching out to see if they have Recruiters on their team already because if they don't then we know okay hey uh we're not going to reach out to them because they might already have this taken care of another thing to do uh with traction is if they recently brought on a chief marketing officer that's a great time who to say oh like do you want to fill up your marketing team you know I'm sure you want to make it a lot of new hires so that's a traction thing that you don't have to rely solely on the the uh the open jobs Playbook here and so that this is just a way of thinking that really it really depends on your industry I can't really give hard things here because everybody has a different industry for for they're doing sometimes it's seasonal you know like warehousing is very seasonal and so things like that and so um the last play that I just want to show as a part of this workflow is we could also use clay to find people so we're g to find people from linkon we can also use clay to find people who just recently left a job and then it's so funny usually we find people because we want to Target those people but in this case we're GNA like find these people to then Target the companies that they used to work at and then we're going to go find the decision makers at those companies and say oh like don't you want to replace this person so again we'll just do sales again and so we'll hit sales United States and now I want a person who maximum months in current role I want them to be there for like two months and keywords and experience description we don't need that we don't need that I'm going to limit the results to like 250 and so now we're just going to run this I'm going to pause so it just loads all right so we have all of these people what we really want to do is we want to enrich their profile \[Music\] so uh enrich person by profile because what we really want is we want their experience timeline so let's roll this through all right so now we have all these people what's up who is this Riley okay great so Riley I mean I don't think I'd ever reach out to Riley um but I mean sorry Riley it's your sales Associated are um camp counselor okay so we have there so what we want to do is see how we have this start date for um yeah so what we need to handle is like we need is current to be true and we need the start date so what we need to think about handling just so you know what I'm thinking about right now is the fact that sometimes people might have three EXP experiences at a company and it's just completely different companies so what we're going to do is we're going to filter this list of objects and so our array is their uh experience so we don't want the imported profiles we want this and so the array is their experience and we're going to insert all and then the filter field is we need to uh filter field it's interesting clay you have to like open this up and then I want experience and then I want this and see how it's company undor domain all lowercase that's how we're going to write it so we're going to go company underscore domain filter mode equals and then the values we're just going to put the company domain here uh actually we're not going to do equals we're going to say does not contain because I want that that top one so we'll hit this so now this is going to bring a filtered list of objects we're going to get the first one so remember Riley she was a summer camp counselor so the first experience that does not include this company domain is what we're going to get so now we'll do like this person right so their start date was here and then they left in April and now if we just want to check this person they started this job 20238 20234 so it took them four months to find a job okay Okay cool so now what we're going to map is basically I want to take this first one and I want to say okay great end date 2023 0401 and then we're going to make a formula so I'm going to say is this date from 3 months ago and we just want to confirm that it was pretty recent false false false okay so somehow this isn't working I this just worked so I'm the it's I think it's because the date is a little odd so we're going to hit normal like format date and time and so we're going to map the date the end date and I just want it to look like that and then we can run that and now we'll write another formula say was this date 3 months uh within 3 months from now and we map the date format date and time and then I want full date time sure why not let's take that one whatever okay let's try this why is it saying true this is so interesting oh H yeah I kind of get that so it might be just saying true because we're in like October and I don't know when it's actually counting it so whatever we'll we'll just work with this so we're going to run all of these and so basically so now this is funny because there's no input over here so now what we can do is we can filter this and we can write one more formula to basically be like output true if formula is true and end date is not empty I'll hit generate now we get this output for the ones that we want to reach out to and so now these people these actual people are good ones to reach out to so we'll hit imported profiles Formula One we'll say is not empty all right so now we've turned this list into 57 people that we can actually reach out to that now the like so Cameron Cameron works at Leviathan security group right as a sales development representative they started 2023 0801 so in August and they used to work at ISL learning and they left back in oh whoops so they left back in August right so now we can reach out to this company and we could say oh hey like I noticed that um Cameron moved on from the company you know how how have you thought about filling their position so then what we would do is like so the way we're going to find this is we're going to say like uh company we are reaching out to URL so this is their old experience right this person left they left 2023 0701 right so they might still be searching for a person to replace them because it takes months to find these people right so now we can hit find contacts at company we can have uh company we were reaching out to URL and then we can do like owner whoops owner president CEO whatever you want like whoever your decision maker is run this save and run and now like whoever the decision maker is now we find these contacts and then you can use WR to Table in which I guess maybe I should just show you um now we have all these contacts right and so now what we can do is we can hit whoops exit we can hit right the table on this actually we could just come in here take action on list write each line to a new table and now we would have to have a table ready but this is exactly what it would look like we would now write this to a completely new table we'd map everything that we want we would want to take this person's name because remember Gino doesn't work at this company anymore we're going to reach out to this person and say like oh like Gino you know used to work there and like Gino's not there anymore what do you want to do about that right and so we would use right to table to be able to do this you this is how you found your people you could see all my other videos of how you find the email addresses and everything and uh yeah so as far as oh I guess it didn't create the column whoops um so when it comes to Staffing and recruiting this is often the three playbooks that I tell people hey I think these are the really good ones for you to go after and essentially how you set all of them up so I hope this was helpful um I know that I I basically did the top level here I didn't show a full campaign setup if anyone would want to see a full campaign setup just comment on this video and and I'll get it done eventually I'm looking at a huge list of videos I want to do but yeah this is basically the way that we think about running playbooks for Staffing and recruiting companies\#\# Date

\# Cold Email Copywriting 2023

hey everyone my name is Eric noislowski and in this video we're going to go over some cold email copywriting Frameworks things to keep in mind and some best practices that I've found while doing cold email for over three years now uh doing cold email as well as some other outbound marketing as well and in this video we're going to cover first things to keep in mind before you start your sequence second a little bit of things to think about when you think about your offers and your angles the general framework that I like to follow for a good Standalone cold email and then we're going to talk about the overall sequence of a cold email and how it all fits together so with that let's jump straight in the reason I have put the ad week copywriting handbook right on the front of this document is because I think this is one of the best copywriting books ever written and I could also reduce the entire book down to one lesson and that lesson is does the first line sell the reader on reading the second line and does the second line sell the reader on leading the third line and does the third line sell their reader I'm selling the on reading the fourth line and so on and so forth and I think this is one of the best lessons uh from this book and for cold email in general because a lot of the times we are not thinking about you know why should somebody keep reading we just keep thinking our product and service is so good it'll Market itself people just flock to it anyway and what we really need to focus on is how can we write a line that somebody will feel like okay you know I read that line I should keep going to the next line ah interesting I read the second line I should definitely go to the third line and you keep winning their time as you keep going uh down through your email and so I always keep that on the top of my mind when I'm thinking about copywriting and I think it's one of the biggest lessons that we should all keep in mind as well so some other things that we should keep in mind before we start my biggest gripe with most people who do cold email is that we do not write like we're humans I see this all the time when we are doing cold email copywriting it seems like there's some marketing language in our brain that doesn't get tapped until we have to start typing out a cold email that we just say things that you would never say in a regular email we say things like hey just following back of following up circling back to uh you know I would love to chat with you do you have 15 minutes here's my calendly link all these things that no human ever says that when people are talking to each other and back and forth like they never say any of those things and so I always say that the highest level of email that you could send the one that's going to be the most relevant with the best timing and has the highest likelihood of a cold person to respond is when you reach out to that podcast host or to a CEO with a social media following or somebody who wrote a really good book and you reach out to them and you say Hey you know I just finished some content I just read your stuff I learned this I had a question about this no could you help me out those emails people respond to all the time unless they're ridiculously famous and they they don't check the emails they don't have time for those things anymore they respond to those things all the time and it's because it's a human talking to another human now of course when we're selling when we're sending cold emails we don't we didn't just listen to their entire podcast we uh you know are seeing if there's any relevance with our product and their problem uh but that kind of language and that syntax I think is really important to keep using those kinds of things instead of this marketing language that for some reason we talk about remember that the goal is to get a response not to get them to buy and so so often people are trying to get people to buy on the very first email these are usually newer marketers who are new to you know sales and they might be technical they've never done this before the amount of energy it takes to take a cold Prospect a dead cold Prospect into a warm customer who is taking out their wallet and swiping their credit card is a lot of energy it's not it's not something that just happens overnight there's a lot of work that goes into it and in order to get somebody to know like and trust you the first thing that you need to get them to do is to get uh is to respond to your email not to just buy your your software a big reason that somebody will respond to your email is if you are extremely valuable what can you provide usually this is the Insight that your company uh has learned what can you provide to them that other people cannot or they're not willing to provide to them for free you always want your emails to be as valuable as possible and we'll try to talk about that as we're going through the Frameworks what's something that your competition uh cannot say but you can right so I just gonna use the lead generation uh company example because I see it all the time and I'm in the industry as well doing a cold email agency you know everyone in the industry can say hey I can help you get leads and I can automate your prospecting and how would you love to just wake up to positive responses every day and you know these kinds of things everyone can say that that when you send that email you look like everybody else it doesn't matter and so you know in my company I tell everybody all the time uh we have access to over I would say 60 databases and we have custom scraper Uh custom web scraping people on the team and so we are able to provide a level of data relevance and personalization that other agencies just cannot compete with because we have so much data and we can laser focus in on your target prospects that is the way that we differentiate and we're going to say that in the email there's because that is our winning Factor not everybody can say that always speak to how you can enable someone not just about the features that you provide best example I have for this is if you are trying to sell a weight loss pill you tell somebody that the pillow is going to help them lose 10 pounds you don't tell them the 70 ingredients that are in it to help them lose those 10 pounds so we always want to speak in a way of how can we enable somebody what's the transformation that we cause what's the end goal that if they follow our program use our product use our service that they will be able to achieve always keep it short you know this I still can't believe that people are still sending emails that are three paragraphs long if an email is over 100 125 words I would even say 75 words it's way too long keep it super short people don't have time you're interrupting them keep it ridiculously short and if you can't keep it short you don't understand your product or service and your customers well enough yet uh don't send too many follow-up emails actually I wrote four over two to three weeks I'd say even four over four to six weeks uh is the way to do it if we have really good data I know everybody says in sales that all the money's made in the follow-up that's just not true when it comes to cold email uh if you follow up with somebody every three days with eight emails in a sequence you're just gonna make people mad more than anything your most of your positive responses are going to come from the first email and then the second email uh as you keep going down in the sequence it just even if people are responding it's mostly negative we have really great data to support this sales Labs has data on this and Gartner has data on this uh just keep talking to new people why waste your time talking to the same people especially in the way that email deliverability is uh these days just talk to somebody else don't keep talking to the same person if especially if they haven't responded and talk and then if your Market is small and another two three months reach out to them again and see if the timing's better only eight percent of buyers are in a buying window right now and your job is to find them and you know build enough brand that even when they're not in the buying window they'll remember you for when you are and that's why you want to be extremely valuable as well so a little topic about you know what is your offer an angle I think this is the most important line that every founder executive anybody who's selling a product or service needs to understand right from the beginning how a offer all boils down to what you can say in this one sentence we help these types of people accomplish this result in this time that is the most General way or the most overarching way to create an offer that people can quickly understand and will translate in all of your marketing you could use that in ads you could use that in cold emails you could use that on LinkedIn you could do whatever that is ridiculously important and so then that's your offer when it comes to offers there are only three there's get paid get laid or live forever there's no other offer they all come back down to those three offers either you're helping somebody make more money you're helping them build their status or you're helping them live forever some kind of Health offer of course right and so when you have figured out your offer and you've deduced it and you understand and you have something that your prospects will really resonate with you also want to understand your angles and so when I talk about marketing angles mostly what I'm talking about here is if you have a product that will analyze the search engine optimization of a company's website your offer is that you can improve there you can help Founders improve their organic search traffic in three months or you can help them improve their organic search traffic in six months I know this stuff takes time whatever time frame you want to put on it but you help Founders improve their search engine traffic hopefully you could say something like you help them improve the search engine uh optimization and they get 45 100 125 more direct traffic in six months whatever it might be now your angle on top of that might be and now because of this you don't have to worry anymore because this you can get a lot more leads because of this you don't have to hire people because this you don't have to manage people because of this you don't have to do their copywriting yourself because of this you don't have to come up with content ideas whatever it might be whatever angle you want to approach that offer from you want to come up with the most winning angle on that does it help them save time what are what are these people most concerned with are they mostly concerned with saving time are they mostly concerned with the fact that Google is Banning AI content like what's that angle that you can put on your offer that they're going to resonate with so kind of in summary there's two things that they're going to resonate with is it the offer and what's the angle that you're going to approach that offer at to present to them so when we go to the general framework of a good cold email we're going to first start with the subject line and in my opinion the subject line should of course be two to three words very very short I sometimes never even capitalize any of the words in the subject line uh but what I like to do is I like to send a subject line that it is possible that a customer or a fellow colleague sent them that email and the reason for that is because people get a ton of emails and they are quickly figuring out if it's an email that they should read or if it's an email that they should just click Mark as read or if people delete the emails whatever it might be and so they're going to see that it's from a person that they don't recognize and if the subject line is don't hire your next sales development representative until you do this that is 100 every single time a marketing email there's none of their friends are sending them that none of their colleagues are sending them that a customer is never saying that it's never happening but if you send them an email and it says monthly SEO Analytics you know who's this coming from is this like you know maybe a colleague is sending this to me maybe a a person from a networking group is sending me this maybe a vendor is sending me this possibly you know a customer well a customer really won't send you that but anyway so you know that is a subject line that they're going to open far more often than the subject line that is clearly a marketing subject line right A lot of these uh headlines that work really well for SEO articles will never work in in email like oh 10 things to think about before you had no don't don't don't send that in a cold email 100 no the biggest thing that I have to say here is to never lie never say something like I have a customer for you and then start pitching your lead generation Services you didn't have a customer for them you don't have a customer lined up unless you do have a customer lined up which is possibly a phenomenal uh prospecting campaign if you've already gotten the customers for them and you just want to give it to them then you're not lying give them the customer that might be too salesy for them though and they might uh delete it anyway but still the same thing being said never lie in the email you can you know say things again like a colleague or that possibly a customer would say but never lie and make them feel like you deceived them with your your subject line always make sure that it's it's connected to the the message line one I always use this as the line where we talk about the trigger the fact that we notice about their company the excuse you have for reaching out you just saw their LinkedIn post uh you know the this this is where you share this is the relevant reason why I'm reaching out to your company right now you know I was looking at your company like I keep using the SEO agency uh you know I was looking at your company and I used the similar web Chrome extension and saw that in the last three months your traffic has been declining you know and then keep going with your email right I uh was on your website and it was using built with Chrome extension and I saw you using HubSpot would you happen to be using that for marketing emails because you know you're wasting money doing that that's another way to think about it what it what is the thing what is the homework that you've done that you're bringing to them and saying hey I I noticed this about your company and when I noticed these things about my company about your company from my experience this means some type of insight and so as we keep going into it line two is where we talk about the enablement how can we help them with uh our product or service back to the SEO agency you know I know if the first line is you know I looked at your traffic in the past three months and it looks like it's been in Decline for the past three months uh you know then you could talk about you know I just helped well now we're kind of getting into the social proof part but maybe I would just jump straight to the social proof part um but you could basically talk about here how you know there's a variety of reasons why traffic goes down a big reason could be because there's not enough content going onto your website you know we just helped and then you can get into social proof which we don't have to get to anyway but you talk about you know how can you enable them with your product or service in order to do better or what's your product or service that can help them do better then the social proof just like I said you know a lot of times people don't have enough content going into their site I was looking at your blog and the last one posted was you know three years ago I just helped you know another company that's relevant to their industry relevant to the employee head count I just helped them uh you know increase their search traffic by 250 in six months this is really a lot of times where you're putting uh a small version of your offer right because if your offers we help these types of people accomplish results in time this is where you basically say I helped this company or I help these kinds of companies accomplish this result in this amount of time and that's my social proof um and then we follow up with an interest-based call to action and so if you are using a call to action with something like if you know you're interested in hearing more book A Time on my calendly again that breaks our act like a human rule that is not what humans would do that is not a human sounding email uh only marketers are sending those emails right one of my favorites right now is if we could help you with problem would that be useful to you very conversational to the point all they have to say is yes or no that would be useful or whatever it might be you know I'm not asking them about you know hey what was your life story with your SEO team you know like did they all did you die two years ago before they you know and they didn't publish any more content whatever it might be just an interest-based call to action just get a response don't worry about selling the entire solution right away and so if that's the framework of just the one email this is the framework that we think about for the whole sequence and so we talked about earlier in the video why we like for email sequence this is the usually the way that I like to set it up so email one is very much in this framework right and I call this the initial spear uh well I'm not the only one who calls it this but with this framework we're going to talk about what's the noticing we have about the company what's how do we enable people what's the super valuable thing that I'm going to share with them what's the reason that they want to respond what's my social proof and what's my call to action and so uh one thing I've thought about no and I do this all the time actually is reaching out to people and saying you know hey I noticed that you're in the financial services industry and you've got a company with 15 employees from my experience that means that you have to keep your team lean and mean I'm seeing some campaigns work right now for financial services companies that are getting about two to three positive responses a day ready for their sales team to go after um you know I helping you know this company do this right now is this something that would be useful to you right and so basically I'm telling them like look I have campaigns that are already working in your space would you want to hear about it actually I wouldn't even even just say that I would say you know here are two campaign ideas that are working right now and then I would list out the campaign ideas just give it to them they're not going to run it themselves they don't have time to run it themselves they don't care about cold email just give them the campaign and I would say look like these things are working right now I know that they're working here's my social proof here's the campaign idea you know we're targeting people who just recently changed jobs and uh we want to know if they're doing their rollover correctly I have all the data for it I already have the copywriting for it this company I'm already helping them get results with it would you be interested to hear more or if following my own advice if I could help you connect with these people would that be useful to you something like that email number one email two I like to add more of that enablement in email one constantly I'm writing email one and then I'll come back two hours later and I shorten email one whatever I took out of email one usually that just becomes email two so I might have said um you know hey you know we're contacting people who just recently changed jobs and seeing if they need help with their new benefits package or their rollover plans and the way that we find them is on LinkedIn using these filters well let me take out the LinkedIn part from the email one and I'm going to put it into email too and I'll say something like you know hey first name to add a little bit more context to the above email the way that we're able to do this is uh we are constantly monitoring sales navigator for uh people who change jobs and then when they do change those jobs we reach out on behalf of you to see uh if they're in need of your services uh you know and we and I'll say again you know we have the copywriting I can I have a video to show you how to build the list you know would that be interesting to you or just something other valuable that I can share and just try to get a response from them to just get the conversation going right and then email three this is why I spoke about angles before the angle is really important that you approach from because I might be saying that in these first emails in that situation I'm saying I'm going to be able to help you drive more Revenue right and the way I help you drive more revenue is because my offer is cold email services but possibly they might not care about that angle they might not care about more Revenue they might be stressed out at home and they haven't had a date night in months and they haven't seen their kids because they're doing crazy amounts of things so I'll take that offer and I'll change the angle and so instead of you know I'm going to enable you to make so much more money I might say Hey you know with these Services we also help our clients save a ton of time so it's the same offer but now I'm saying instead of I'm going to increase your Revenue I save you a ton of time you don't have to do this prospecting on your own anymore we have a system for it we can do it so in email three we'll switch it oftentimes because if they didn't respond to email one and two and they didn't respond to that angle email three they're not going to respond either and so then email 4 I just want to get straight I know I called it the breakup email I hate breakup emails I I think that they are ridiculous in the way that most people send breakup emails and so what I mean by that is a lot of people send breakup emails and they'll say Hey you know it seems like either you died in a ditch or you're not interested in this right now and so I'm going to make the decision to stop emailing you you've lost the opportunity to take part in my product or service unless you've respond to this email I'm never going to sell it to you ever again and that just makes no sense one you kill all of your status Delta that and if you're sending that email you probably had no status until the entire time you're killing uh you know the pro it just feels weird there's just no reason to send that email and so what I like to send instead is some kind of is an email where I'm breaking up with that person but I'm wondering if there's somebody else in the company that I should be speaking to and I'll say something like you know hey first name noticed at Acme Corp there's 255 employees perhaps this isn't your area focus is there somebody else that I should be speaking to and I'll just route myself someplace else um because or try to at least and in that way we do get the benefit because there is data to back up that people respond to break up emails more than they respond to the other emails it's just I think there's something about knowing that oh okay yeah like this is the last time somebody's gonna follow up with me um maybe I did actually need to talk about this but I kept forgetting about it there's value in doing that but not by saying oh hey I'm never going to contact you again you know you hurt my feelings by not uh responding to my email and so we'll just see okay hey like you're probably the wrong person to talk to is there somebody else at the company that I should be speaking to instead and we'll take it that way and so these are you know my general thoughts on email copywriting the framework that we approach it by the uh you know the components and the building blocks of the email and then how we think of the overall sequence obviously we can improve this a ton not only because uh you know I'm sure my knowledge could improve but also you could add LinkedIn to this you could add cold calling this you could add advertisements to this whatever it might be uh to improve these things but you know for Eric 2023 this is the way I view cold email and if you have any suggestions to this I'm more than happy to hear I do not think that I know everything about cold email uh I'd be happy to you know see if anybody has any comments or anything that they would improve about this so anyway thanks for watching and I hope to see you on the next one\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\#\#\# Transcript

hey everyone I haven't posted in a little while and I've just been busy doing other stuff uh so I wanted to show you probably the craziest campaign we have ever launched it's probably eight campaigns in one I would say no seven seven campaigns in one and so I'm gonna read through all of them and I'm gonna just talk about you know how we put together them together and kind of the philosophy and then I'm going to show the clay table on how to get this done and so if you are a person who is following these videos just because you're interested in what is possible with cold email the first part of the video is going to be for you and if you want to see how to get this done that's going to be the second part of the video this will probably be the longest video I create so I'll try to keep it as engaging as possible but I can't make any promises I'm just gonna get into it I'm just gonna show everything exactly the way that we do it and so I basically wanted to do a three touch email where the base of the campaign was talking about uh how like this this is basically the campaign and then we're pitching that we can do uh cold email Automation Services for them um and then it was just like a video of how they could get started right and so this right here is the total base of the campaign I was taking a look at your website and figure you sell too that's funny you sell it to job pedals like AI generation most mostly to help them AI Generations so this is going to read something like us taking a look at a website and figured you sell to job titles like uh directors of demand generation Vice President of Sales Chief Revenue officer and chief Revenue officers mostly to help them improve their sales force metrics or or whatever the company does and we're going to slide that straight into them so if you're trying to reach out to the prospects what's called demos like this we built a system that does this automatically could I send you a video of how you would get started and so this is the base of the campaign and so the campaign changes depending on what's true about them so first we check to see if they have sdrs on their team if there's sdrs on the team we're actually going to mention the SDR on the team uh let's see this is just the fallback message if they were recently hired and were targeting a marketer or VP of sales that was recently tired we're gonna call that out in this campaign or if they recently posted on LinkedIn we're gonna call that out and so I call these trigger-based campaigns because they are only possible to happen if something is true about the company and so the other or the company or the person so these other campaigns could technically work on anybody and we could run them for anybody but these campaigns specifically have to work only if we can detect the LinkedIn post if they have sdrs on their team or if they were recently hired and that's why we start the whole flow with those then the random campaigns uh this is like something I've always wanted to try and it worked so well I am not going to show the responses today but the responses were were really really great this worked really really well um and I'm not going to show the responses only just because I'm just not doing the work to block out the images sorry whatever um so I was taking a look at your website and I figured you sell to why is that typo everywhere and figure yourself the job pedals like blah blah mostly to help them do blah blah so it's a pretty generic message but then at the end what we're saying is I've made a workflow where if we're emailing the chief marketing officer we would send them something like oh hey like here's the answer to the riddle I sent a similar email to your CEO and uh they're gonna look for you for this answer and then we sent the CEO a very similar message but we put the riddle for them and we said oh we sent the the answer to this riddle to your Chief marketing officer and in both instances we're naming them so I'm saying like the CEO's name and I'm saying the marketer's name and so this was I could probably create a video like only on this of how we made this happen so I'll get to this one in a little bit this was a lot of fun to Launch then we have a get ahead of competitors campaign um so very similar and then we're calling out and saying like crunchbase told me that you usually compete with companies like competitor and so I'll show you how we pulled together that information um as well to just personalize by the competitor um then oh this was so great I loved doing this one and I wish more people would qualify for this one but we just need to make sure that the AI is really really tight so here what we did is we were saying hey I was taking a look at your website and I figure you sell to job titles like AI generation mostly to help them do AI generation I went on LinkedIn and found a person that could be a good Target For You full name company name title work email we have all of this stuff in the workflow if this one lead isn't enough for you we built a system that does this automatically could I send you a video of how you could get started boom boom boom that's basically how we would get this done and now for the rest of the sequence so these all it depends on what sequence they're going to put in and we got to do this that and the other thing and like all this craziness to get them sorted so uh that's how this one would work and then email two and email three is still personalized with artificial intelligence it's just everybody is going to get email to and email three and we're not going to um you know do any kind of like switching or triggers for them at all here and so we'll say from my previous research I have to imagine that your outbound campaigns look something like this and then we're gonna drop some creative outbound campaign ideas in here are you still doing this work to put this together um are you still doing the work to put this together automatically or have you figured out a way to build a system to accomplish this for you Jesus like manually we've helped companies like clay and owner.com build these systems to book meetings on their sales teams calendars would uh want to chat about how we could do it for you um this email in the previous team were both automatically generated let me know if we should get lost or if this would make sense if it would make things more interesting uh to keep the automation funnel live I had our AI copywriting build a sequence for you and I'll put that in the PS would it be useful to chat about how we can improve the copy and launch a campaign for you signature and then we're gonna put the the campaign in here and so now if you're just intrigued by how we got this done let's jump into the clay table and so here's our clay table this is all very generic data up until here so the first thing that we're doing is we enrich the LinkedIn company URL with the company description and then we check using artificial intelligence to see if it's a B2B company or a b2c company if it's a B2B company they continue with the workflow if it's a b2c company we kill the whole workflow see how it says run condition not met over here because we just don't even they're not even a b2c company and so uh once it's a b2c company we just kill the whole thing we only want to reach out to B2B companies um and as you can see we put 28 000 people through this so we checked every single time to see if there would be to be company and that's what kicks off the rest of the workflow so the first thing that we did is we scraped their LinkedIn to find a post that they made in the last 30 days and so that was really easy to set up literally 30 days ago and this is all that we're doing and we're just checking to see if they posted on LinkedIn so then we could create something like I just saw your post about the Mars conference I just saw your post about following a vegan diet I just saw your post about the road trip just saw your post about future of work right and so we're pulling in all of these and so you can see like 2023 Executives must get Savvy snag and talent focused on employee mental health and confront all this hashtag future of work perfect and so we're personalizing it by the LinkedIn post summary oh here oh geez I guess I skipped ahead because I put all this over here so that the main Crux of the message is knowing who they sell to and um how they help their customers and so here we took their LinkedIn description after we know that it's a B2B company and we wanted to know what kinds of uh titles that they sell to and so I gave it two examples one where it's not totally like a job title local CEOs companies looking to invest in Connecticut and Community stakeholders right those aren't job titles just in case they don't specifically sell to like a job title they sell to a type of person and then here I put job titles because if it's job titles we just wanted that and so you could see like this company what does this company do ICL uh shipments Consulting okay selling to supply chain managers Transportation Specialists and Automotive Logistics coordinators I would say it nailed it that that's perfectly true there and it looks like you mostly helped manage and optimize Transportation processes perfect again that's going to be the Crux of our message so now we have the LinkedIn post summary and then we have the scr on team call out so we're finding the contacts at the company and we have the job title keywords and we excluded keywords over here as well and then we're finding these profiles when we find these profiles we're putting them in here and we're saying hey I noticed you have some scrs on a team like Matt l i noticed you have some sdrs on your team like Abigail Haven I noticed you have your sdrs on your team whoops where did it go I noticed you have some CRS on a team like Alexandra Elliott and so basically we're just working through all of these in order to find sdrs on the team and then they qualify for that first campaign that we're talking about and then the final campaign that we need to just check for is we're enriching this person to see if they recently started their uh their role and so nobody here actually recently started but you'll see we've enriched the LinkedIn profile and then we've formatted the date and time and then basically I'm doing a date check where then if this worked it's a true right it would it would output this congrats on taking the new role as senior vice president back in January but we're going to reverse that and so then this is exactly how this would work so in the recent higher line would pop up I don't see anybody that actually qualified for it though oh yeah here we go congrats on taking the new roles chief executive officer back in March awesome so now this is the part that gets really really long uh this is where we're gonna go over uh uh so this is where we're gonna go over how we did the riddle like this is this is my one of my favorite things so since we're doing random campaigns um I assigned a random number to all of these campaigns and I let's see yeah so if it was one in the randomization we run this and if it's two we're gonna run something else if it's three we're gonna run another thing and so the first thing that I wanted to do was I wanted to find I needed to map who are we reaching out to at the company right so I created a map for CEOs and I created a map for chief marketing officers so here's the person yeah CEO and then sales and marketing and so if you if we look at like 24 and 28 so I needed to map to CEO right so we're going to jump over here our advisor to CEO all right missed a little bit but that's fine chief executive officer that's exactly what we wanted to do so then now it maps to hold on where is it now it maps to the CEO and then if it maps to other it's going to map to other and so now if it maps to CEO we're going to try to find a marketing person at the company so this one mapped to CEO we found the marketing person it's Heather they're the director of marketing operations awesome we have ai to clean that job title because we just need to cool so then so now it's like okay if we're reaching out to the CEO we need to find the marketing or sales person and we're going to send them something different if we are reaching out to the sales or marketing person we need to find a CEO which for some reason this didn't qualify for numerous reasons let's see if we can find anything that does here uh nope jeez where is it cool so we have sales and marketing here see how now we're looking for the co-founder or the CTO and so now we're reaching out to Ben so now we can map perfectly so we can always find a person so if we're reaching out to the sales and marketing person we're going to find the CEO for reaching out to the CEO we're going to find the sales and marketing person and so we can always flip flop between the two of them and so now what we can do is we clean the job title and now we have our riddle formula and so this is kind of confusing to get together if you have any questions make a comment but now we have all of this now what we do is we have a formula where we're basically saying okay titles we're reaching out to include CEO which that's right here and that's being mapped over here if that includes CEO we're going to say PS I had a riddle for you what can you catch but never throw I sent a similar email with the answer to other contact well then let's just read this uh I had a riddle for you what can you catch but never through I sent a similar email with the answer to Grant rendu on your team give it a think before you ask them so now we're sending the CEO this message and we're saying hey your VP of sales got the answer and then when we're emailing the co-founder we're saying PS I sent a similar email oh no wait see this is even confuses me we're sending this email not we're not sending this email to Ben we're sending this email to uh whoever is in this campaign so whoever is 253 so this email is going to Michael who's the VP of institutional sales right and so then oh whoops so now this is the line we're going to say hey Michael P.S I sent a similar email to your boss because he's the VP of institutional sales and the answer is a cold they might reach out for it then we're going to reach out to Ben and we're gonna say hey Ben I had a riddle for you what can you catch but never throw I sent a similar email with the answer to Michael Pinella on the team give it a think before you ask them and so now we have this very like fun personalized Outreach to people um and so yeah this was just like this took a lot of work to put together and I had a lot of fun with it um I'm not sure if I would put it into a campaign in the future because it's so annoying to put this part together um but it was a lot of fun so let's see uh first name normalize the URL oh okay so now we're gonna keep working so now we have to do the competitor Outreach and so oh is this the competitor Outreach see I don't even know yes so the Google search that I found that gets people's competitors the best in my opinion is if you search for the website the country of the company and then you just say competitors and so um what you're gonna get is you're gonna get this huge snippet like this where you're gonna get these results I put in for three results um and so we're searching for competitors here great and so we have this huge snippet what we're then going to do is jump in here and we're going to use AI to figure out who the competitor is so I'm saying hey review the text and return results for who a company's competitor might be the output should just be the competitor and nothing else the company name we're looking for uh competitors on is this company for emails so this name cannot possibly be in the search result this is the text I want you to review if you cannot determine a name of a competitor with 95 accuracy do not output anything the output should only name one company just the one company name is the output and then I trained it a couple of times on how to find the competitors uh I didn't save anything so that's fine and so now we have our competitor call outs to to do here and so let's see if we can find any companies that we actually might know and see how this goes um yeah I don't know any of these companies but if we take a quick field trip and so peoplevest is a consulting firm people knows moving Parts okay so this is this is a Consulting form our philosophy yeah okay and oh there we didn't get any competitors from people vest of course let's see here line X okay fat lipco what is fat lipco creative Studio okay line x what is line X puppies why is it being this difficult anyway this is just like you can see that it's aller.com that's the the competitor look up here so we can check a couple other but I don't want to get into it too much so now oh okay so now this is another fun one that was really interesting to put together so I just want to remind you of what we're doing here so here we're saying hey it was on your website and saw yourself these job titles I was one on LinkedIn I found a person that could be a good Target For You full name company name title and then work email if this lead wasn't enough for you we could build these systems automatically and so basically what we're doing is we're taking the customer titles that they sell to over here and I'm just getting everything before the first comma to get this person and so what we're saying is over here software Engineers right and then it says so I got everything before the first comma and then I just needed to take out the s in the beginning so brand managers and then we just needed to take out the s and then I used AI to review the company description and then just output a company that I think would be a good fit and so uh here is the company that could be a good fit for them and then all we're doing is putting into a Google search literally just the company Target and the title cleaned for LinkedIn so we're looking literally Googling marketing direct marketing directors brandless and then this is Preston caramela director of operations okay interesting that totally was kind of okay e-commerce manager cool everlane that worked Grant yang software engineer Square perfect so we have all these people and then we have the email address for them and then we map this into the campaign because we have the name we have the title we have the company that they work at and we have a valid email address over here and so then that is how we got down to the one that's a good fit for them then we have the creative ideas over here which creative ideas is pretty stock for us you know and so basically we're saying like hey I bet you're doing these things um are you still doing this work to put it together manually or have you figured out a way to build a system to accomplish this for you and then um so that's how we're taking care of the creative ideas one and then here we're writing copywriting for them so we'll say like so this is literally writing a campaign for them um and so if you look at this I noticed brainstorm Tech Excel is a creative and problem solving but you're maximizing similarity our client Big Ideas was great at ID dating great and so like if we look at the company description I just want to show you how this is working oh I just thought of how the way we can improve this okay so what this company does is the union of investing that was established um a number of members occupy leading positions in the market great and so looks like you mostly help promote and develop armenia's ICT sector it's actually boosting our media but are you reaching out yeah and so actually I'm gonna fix this one live so the way we can improve this um do not mention our company and we are reaching out to the prospect these are the job titles we reach out to well and then we can just we'll just save and do not run for this because we haven't run this um yes we we ran just so everyone knows I know it looks a little odd putting this together we've run the first emails up here and I just wanted to show how we're going to be doing email two and three we haven't actually launched two and three yet as you can see there's like nothing put coming over here and so um this is just how we would get it done though and I'm using this for demonstration purposes and so let's see this one we're also taking the like we're taking Mark Smith and writing an email to Mark Smith so I see your loan officer at Lending Club Bank ever find yourself needing more time to focus on your business uh we helped ABC assisted fintech XYZ increasing efficiency by 37 giving more time for clientele imagine what you could do with that extra time trusted by various procedure week sale meeting loan software needs boom boom boom and so that's what we're doing over here and so I'll be improving these but this is basically how it goes so I know now this is a 20 minute video but I hope something was interesting to you here and you got inspired by something that we did or something you found interesting let me know if there's any kind of campaigns that you would want to see usually we could create these and I have a lot of fun putting them together as you could obviously see so thanks and have a great day\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

\# I Put Everything I Know About Cold Email in One Google Doc

everyone I spent probably multiple days a week for three or four weeks putting together a 50-page document going over as much as I could put down about cold email and so today I'm going to share it with you I'm going to be kind of reading off of the doc but I really want to read off of the doc to just add more color to the doc um and the doc is going to be linked Below in the YouTube video and I hope that you just hopefully learn something if you disagree with me I would love to hear about it and uh yeah let's jump into the video Let's jump in the mission of this document is in order to give transparency around cold email campaigns uh I wanted give benchmarking and I also wanted to show a little bit of the process that I personally go through when we create outbound cold email campaigns so the reason I think transparency is important is I think a lot of times people share screenshots on LinkedIn and they you know talk about wow you know our campaign is so amazingly great my agency is so awesome we can crush it for anybody we do you know all we do is win blah blah blah blah and oftentimes if you look at those screenshots they're showing campaigns with you know less than 700 leads in it which uh makes me think that they're probably emailing a list that they can email once and that's it you know that campaign's over you don't have a predictable pipeline you got a burst of really good leads and then after that you know you have to go kick rocks and try to figure out another campaign and so I want it to be extremely transparent about how we create C campaigns and the success that we generate for campaigns as well um and then give some benchmarking clients come to us all the time and they say you know what could we expect and I always say I don't know and we're going to get into a couple of the reasons why uh but at least with this now we have some benchmarks where if you're reading this document if you're watching this video you can compare yourself to one of the campaigns that we've run in the past and think to yourself okay this is pretty similar this is what we should be going for now when it comes to this benchmarking I also know we are not naive enough to say that I we are the greatest outbound agency in the world and so if you beat these numbers please let me know I you know this is all about learning and sharing and so I would love to see uh if anybody beat these numbers on a similar campaign uh I'm not going to publicly put any of the like customer names and things like that for for obvious reasons mostly to protect the campaigns that are working really well um and so if you say you know I think this one's similar and we DM about it happy to chat about that that's then process and so a a big thing that I discuss with potential clients current clients and then with people on LinkedIn and people that I coach and things like that is that I think that cold email is a private ads Network and so what I mean by this in particular is the fact that you just like LinkedIn you you don't go spend money on LinkedIn and spend $20,000 on LinkedIn ads get zero leads and then say h you know LinkedIn is a terrible platform to be to be doing things so oftentimes when people come to a cold email agency or they they start running cold email themselves they think to themselves oh you know like this has got to produce results otherwise it doesn't work and you know it it cold email is not a salesperson or it's not an agency that you can beat down and just squeeze meetings out of right it is a private ads Network um you are in control of the Impressions right so your open rate um even though open rates are inflated I know uh your open rate is uh how many Impressions you're getting and then the positive response rate is your click-through rate or your your conversion there and we have multiple campaigns that we're going to run through that are in industries that that are hard to to get responses from and we show that it was hard to get responses from or we show that hey with a really really great offer you can get responses and so all of this goes into saying that I view cold email as a private ads Network really the bottom line of this means that you can have really fancy targeting really great deliverability you can pay a copywriter to do really fancy copyrighting but unless you have a really really great offer nothing matters your offer is more King than any else just like it would be if you're running Facebook ads or LinkedIn ads and so we're going to go over quickly the cold email infrastructure and segmenting Lead lists and things like this so with the cold email infrastructure here's the bottom line if you go to smart lead. AI or instantly. and you look up the documentation that they have on the website we're doing the same exact thing that they tell you to do we're doing that we're just doing it at scale currently we are we manage over 10,000 inboxes uh in our main smart lead account our main instantly account and then between all of our clients accounts as well we're managing 10,000 inboxes so what I have solved as an agency is scale uh if you think that we've got some special secret sauce and things like that we really don't it's exactly what you find on smart le. and instantly. so for your cold email infrastructure this has good documentation on this but if you just follow their documentation you're going to be in a great place segmenting your lists personally I talk a lot about this on my YouTube channel I think the days of loading up a list of you know companies in the banking industry with 50 to 200 employees and you're emailing the chief marketing officer lists like that I I don't think are going to get you very far uh unless your offer is fantastic and so what we really focus on is segmenting our list into situations so everybody talks about ideal customer profile right and so an ideal customer profile might look like what I just told you 50 to0 employees banking industry Chief marketing officer but I want you to start thinking about segmenting your list into situations what's going on in the company that we could start messaging them about and then we could send far better emails because of that because think about how much better of an email could you send if you know that it's a chief marketing officer with 50 to 100 employees and they're in the banking industry and on their website they uh have a Facebook ads pixel or hiring for a marketing operations person or they're hiring for a graphic designer or their team has no graphic designers on the entire team internally all of these things tell you something different and so a good example that I use is for my agency one email campaign we're running all the time is we're scoring SAS companies to see whose Demar record is incorrect we want to see if it's their first time being a Founder we want to know do they not have a technical background do they have a salesperson but no VP of sales and are they hiring for more sales people and so this is a super super segmented list and so now this person is going to get a particular message because of all this data we don't even need to use AI to write this message because you know we have so many data points about them and then if you say Hey you know Eric that's going to shrink my list too much totally agree with you so then what we do is we just pull out one of those pieces and instead of looking for people hiring for salespeople we just pull that out and now we send a different message to that so think about data segmentation read through this I'm not going to read the the whole thing uh so sequence best practices this is a hill that I will absolutely die on your best performing email in your sequence is email one and two I don't care what anybody says I i' I hear people all the time that like oh my best performing email is email 6 if your best performing email is really email 6 go back and take email 6 and put it to email one I I just don't believe you I if you were to take email 6 and put it into email one it's going to outperform what you had as email 6 something's going on where that messaging is resonating better but if you set things up properly email 1 is going to get more positive responses than any other email in your campaign um so now when this comes to sequence length I see a lot of people still talking about seven eight nine you know email long sequences we just don't do that we found that four is the most that will go and I'm even really now leaning more towards three uh emails in a sequence and so the reason I say this is because yeah you might be getting those positive responses later in your sequence but honestly if you email somebody about needing accounting services and then by the time they get the ninth email in their sequence it's four months later the business has just changed and so now that you've sent all of these emails to people you haven't refreshed any of the data you haven't reloaded it and had figured out more things about their company the amount of people who are marking you a Spam with the more emails that you you send sure you're going to get that one or two positive response but it's not worth the amount of people who are going to Mark you a Spam and so we we use basically this sequence structure so we send email one net new email subject line everything and we I'll go into what we say in each email then we'll follow up to that email with a threaded email usually in that email we're saying things that we didn't have time to say in the first email and then email three completely net new email why do we do this some people they'll follow up three times in the same thread I don't like to do that the big reason I don't like to do that is because when I receive those messages I get three emails in a thread and I just see a big fat reminder about three times well I guess two times before that that you tried to message me and I ignored you and I'm just going to continue ignoring you right and so we send a net new email so that maybe they'll forget about the other emails that we sent and then we can catch them at a different time we'll talk about how we structure email 3 and then email 4 we use as a breakup email that's threaded to email 3 uh we don't actually break up with them and say something stupid like you know I wonder if you got eaten by hippo because that's the only reason you wouldn't respond to my emails we don't say stupid stuff like that I would I say stupid stuff like I'm gonna close your file um and never email you again because that's not true I actually want to email them again but after we refresh the data get a better idea of our customers do better testing and all those things uh okay so in email one this is generally our structure so I like to combine so if you're looking at email copyrighting in my opinion the best people for email copywriting is Josh Brawn and John barrows they've got everything that you need to know about email copywriting so for email one what we like to do is we lead with the why now why you why now uh while we answer that question so basically we either use AI we'll use scrape data we'll use our list to say to them hey the reason I'm reaching out right now is because of blank and it's something going on in their business something going on in the industry something that we noticed about their business whatever it might be then I like to transfer to a poke the bear question uh maybe we'll talk about this a little bit better but this is where Josh Braun talks about asking a question to make the prospect think again about your offer so there's a huge difference between asking somebody you know how's training going for your Iron Man versus how's training going for your Iron Man so you don't get shin splints or you know something like that we're going to get into it even more and then we have our social proof uh where we basically talk about you know what quantitatively what can we do for this uh person or company and then our call to action I like the you know are you opposed to hearing more or is this interesting to you or all those calls to action my personal favorite call to action for email one is if we could help you accomplish blank would that be useful to you you know that's that's my favorite one here so then email two we since we're threading this email to email one we like to use this to provide more context on email one so in if in our social proof we said we helped another company get uh you actually we literally just got this today last year over the course of the year we helped somebody generate 3177 leads from I think it was June to the end of the year and so we could say that as our social proof of course but what we didn't have time to say is how we did it so then we get into email 2 and then we talk about how we generated that so then we could talk about how uh in that campaign in particular uh what we did is we made a really really clean list of marketing agency owners and then each we looked for five variables being true about the company you know do they have a finance team and and are they growing and are they hiring people right now um growth in the past and then are they currently hiring people whatever it might be and then they got a different campaign depending on what was true about them and so uh then I could explain in more depth what we actually did so if you're offer they didn't bite here but maybe you've got something going on they that piques their interest we would do it uh right here and so now email 3 we're going to do two things with email 3 one there's only three offers in B2B there's five offers in the world there's only three offers in B2B the five offers in the world is you can help somebody save time you can help them save money you can help them make more money you can help them live longer or you can raise their status three of those offers have to do have to do with B2B save time make more money save money right in B2B we're really not talking about making people healthier or raising their status maybe a little bit if you want to help them get promotions but if you promise that I'm really not sure how that's it's going to go over for you and so in email 3 what we want to do is if in email one we gave a value proposition around I'm gonna help you save time they didn't respond to that so in email 3 we want to swap it and so now we're going to talk about how we can help them make more money right and however and so I've never really seen an offer that isn't possible to frame in all three and so I'll give you a good example if somebody were to come to me and say hey we have a new email finding tool I try every email finding tool that comes across my my inbox right try them all why not but if they were to say hey we have a new email finding tool it's finding leads faster than anybody else I really wouldn't care uh because we use clay.com everything's hooked up to an API honestly I really don't care if it takes 2 minutes to find an email address versus 10 seconds because it's all hooked up with the API and it's all just going to run itself uh as it goes so I don't really care about it moving faster but if somebody says we have the same accuracy if not better and it's cheaper ah okay so now that's interesting Still Still email data verification but instead of talking about doing it faster we're talking about it being cheaper right and that would Peak my interest so we want to change that the other thing you want to consider in email 3 is you have just asked for a meeting twice and you did not get that meeting so what we want to do in email 3 is lower the friction for them to respond all I'm trying to do here is just get them to raise their hand to something oftentimes what we'll do is if we have a under two-minute video explaining how it works I'll use a call to action like hey Josh seriously no need for the call right now could I send you a video to show you how it works Google punishes me for sending links so then we'll just get them to say yes and now we know that this is a little bit more of an Engaged lead we can turn over the mobile phone number to our clients we can help them connect with them on LinkedIn uh we can follow up with them over email all of these things and so then email four like I said I'm not a big believer in breakup emails I I think most of the time they're stupid but there is evidence to suggest that if you signal to somebody that the end of your sequence is here you will increase your response rate you're going to get a lot of NOS don't get me wrong but there's going to be yeses in there as well and I my hypothesis of this is if you've emailed somebody three times and each time you caught them at a bad time they want to respond but they don't really know what to say you know all these things email 4 is where we can get them off the fence either you're going to say no or you're going to say yes I just got to know which one it is so my current favorite email 4 which so honestly if you receive this from somebody that's not growth engine X it's probably our client I I got to be honest uh well after this video who knows maybe not so first name I know there's about 200 employees over at Acme and perhaps uh marketing automation is not your responsibility should I reach out to and then we'll name and we'll actually name another person at the company that uh we should be reaching out to um and we'll look for somebody who has a similar title that still fits the ICP now honestly we've probably already sequenced this person but if we can get this person to say Hey you know I'm not in charge of this but you're totally right Mary's in charge of it we have a lot more ammunition to go with Mary with we'll put that on a primary domain and we'll send them a uh an email from there and so then people ask me all the time about Tam and basically I want you to read this I don't want to spend too much time on this basically when we do the math for Tam right so if you've got 10,000 people in your Tam you probably shouldn't even hire like a scaled agency like my well no 10,000 we've done leads with 10,000 so say you've got 300 people in your town don't hire my agency it's uh there's no point you can just take care of that yourself but so if you only have 10,000 people in your Tam and you're getting one response for every 300 emails that you send and you want 20 meetings a month that's not going to last very long so you need to be spending your time getting that number down as much as possible but if you got two million people in your Tam and you're getting one positive response for every 300 leads that you contact ramp it up the amount of time that's going to take you to scale that campaign versus maybe going from 300 to 200 don't even worry about it scale that thing up get as many leads as you uh need to fill your pipeline then start talking about going from that 300 to 200 number we'll probably get more into that later this part is uh the part that if you're still watching the video by now I probably should have started with this and maybe I will create a video just on this part because this has really helped me when we create campaigns we basically found found 10 campaigns a CA campaign angles that our campaigns fit in that when they're really successful they they draw on one of these things now oftentimes they do multiple things sometimes we use three of these angles in one campaign but we found that if you include one of these things in a campaign it just increases it a lot and so you could read this on your own I'm going to go through this a little bit quickly so problem sniffing if you could go to a company and you could say hey I was doing research on your company and I think you have this problem if I'm right could I help you fix that problem you're going to get a response so if you email somebody and you say Hey you know I saw that Yelp review that somebody was complaining about all the holes in your parking lot can I pave your parking lot you know you're going to increase your your response rate a lot um truly funny relevant campaigns now this gets a little risky because some people think things are funny and some people don't think that things are funny um this is actually a campaign that Jordan Crawford showed me one time where there was a pest control company that there was a bed bug out break in all of the hotels in Philadelphia and they were cold emailing all of the property managers and the general managers of the hotel with this meme basically saying you know uh hey we heard about the bed bugs you know you know see the image below and then they sent this and they said hey you know just kidding but if you need somebody to take care of the the bed bugs at your hotel you know we're available on Tuesday to come over and everything crushed the campaign it did really really well um so that's why I say truly funny relevant campaigns because you don't want to just go off the deep end with with something crazy this one's one of my favorites I've I haven't seen anybody else do this so I I will lay claim to this one I love using AI to help a prospect Envision what using your product or service is going to be and so this doesn't work for things like if you're selling QuickBooks this isn't going to work everybody uses QuickBooks and they use it basically the same way you're you're tracking financial data right but if you're using uh if you're selling a software like clay.com there's so many ways that one company might use it versus the way another company might use it and so what we do is we scan their website and we scan their uh LinkedIn profile and we write an AI generated response of of how they could really take advantage of it we get really awesome responses on this stars aligning this is just when we use data to send a really really good message because we know that this person has all these problems and we hit on all those problems uh when we're going through it very much suggest for you to to read all of this extremely relevant case studies we've seen awesome success with this I mean it makes a lot of sense if I were to go to any outbound sales tech company or even mtech company or maybe not even just outbound sales Tech if we were just go to a sales tech company and I were to say what we were able to accomplish for clay.com while I was working there and just tell that story people are going to be interested by that and so uh this one's pretty self-explanatory influencer audience targeting if there's ever an influencer who who agrees with our hypothesis on the market and they talk about it publicly I like to use them as like third party proof and say like look you know this person said this and you know what we actually totally agree we built a whole company off this hypothesis and so that that's another good one having a great lead magnet you can run a whole campaign just having a really great lead magnet and so what we'll email people with is we'll just say hey you know if I think that you sell to VPS of sales and chief Revenue officers and uh you know you help them solve the problem album of you know whatever outbound automation um you know that being considered uh you know would you want to hop on a call and I'll give you a list of 5,000 leads for absolutely free so they know that depending on what provider this comes from this is worth anywhere from $500 to well it's anywhere worth anywhere from $50 to like 500 maybe even $1,000 depending on what provider gives this to them and we'll build it all for them and just give it for to them for free on a call and so this is a lead magnet that that works really really great for us um being genuinely useful this is just you know emailing somebody and saying look you know I found this problem I think you should take a look at it our software does this so easily I was able to do this for you without ever talking to you please you know let me know um two sentence email straight to the point this could even be a one- sentence email this is basically you know one time one of our great campaigns that we ran uh we were about to Niche down on Staffing and recruiting and then we went in a different direction because of some problems we found with it the email we sent to get meetings with them was literally hey I just helped another Staffing and recruiting firm we would name drop the firm I just helped another firm uh get you know I think we would even say enough job orders that they had to hire another recruiter could I send you the video of how we did it and then they would get the video the video had a calendly link we would follow up with everybody that we sent the video to you know all of those things and we just just really really short straight to the point flash roll you should really read this one um this is just basically showing a prospect that you know exactly what you're talking about you know their problem really well you know that you can solve it and you speak uh into their their stuff excellent so copyrighting tips and oh so these are just our copyrighting tips and best practices um honestly read through this yourself I'm Not Really Gonna talk through a lot of this um actually this one I'm going to talk through this one I think is so genius so often times we should be handling objections that are in a prospect's mind already and so I I saw this in my hometown and I thought this was absolutely genius so uh it says we are not looking for Heroes just neighbors now recruiting volunteer firefighters freaking awesome right because they are speaking right into your objection right away so if somebody asked me hey do you want to be a firefighter be like eh you know I can't like I'm not Batman like I'm not going to go into a burning building and you know save people and stuff and um you'd be right but the you know that's not what they do the volunteer firefighters are are way less involved uh in very very dangerous fires than the professionals right they'll call in the Professionals for the very dangerous fires and so they said we're not looking for Heroes just neighbors I'm a neighbor you know it fits me perfectly and so they're speaking straight into that objection I you know I just freaking love it here's some copyrighting examples um read through this yourself let's see this this is another Hill that I'm going to die on I see way too many people on LinkedIn saying that GPT GPT 3.5 gp4 gp4 turbo it's not there it's not good enough to write cold emails for you totally disagree we have a client that we tried everything for them and we tried uh you know and I'll get into it but we tried all these things the email that was just generated with ar icial intelligence by scraping the website and giving suggestions remember using AI to help somebody Envision what using your product would look like that campaign outperformed the next best campaign by literally 100% uh the only campaign that got close to it was just giving a free offer to join a Facebook group and so I wouldn't even compare those two and so here we targeted newly hired team members 61 opportunity well don't look at the 61 opportunities because it's got to be like you know 61 for all of the leads that we sent so anyway campaign to Target people using a competitor platform eh did okay messaging Founders about founder Le sales case study matching uh something that was two sentences St straight to the point right campaign matching the technographics of the campaign wow how did that even happen whoops right campaign to join a free community this was a very good ratio and then here was our AI generated campaign 225 opportunities and we were sending two emails this is like 10,000 leads I think it was it was or or whatever this shook out to be um this was the the greatest one that it was it crushed everything else and so I always tell people AI can definitely write your campaigns and you should totally do it so here we have some common data workflows that we use very often in the agency that I just wanted to list out for everybody all of these link to YouTube videos that are already on my channel check them out um so Daniel fio and Christian bonier talk about demand generation versus demand capture and then awareness and I think they they are so so spot on with this that I I put this into the document totally credit to them they they talk about this I learned it from them uh but I think they're really spot on so there's these spectrums that you need to consider when you're launching a campaign how aware are your prospects of your solution and do you have a demand capture solution or do you have a demand generation solution right and so a high awareness offer is bookkeeping everybody knows that bookkeeping is possible I don't know a single entrepreneur that you could walk up to and say hey did you know that there's somebody else who can manage your QuickBooks and they you know it's so so so so obvious low awareness would be uh when I first started my agency we would help people run and promote LinkedIn events and so the LinkedIn events would get a ton of like one time we got a LinkedIn event to like 4,000 people there was a ton of people um registered for that LinkedIn event it builds your email list really well gives a lot of great social proof and then uh what it also does uh is of course you can run the event and then you've got people on your freaking webinar it it's great and so when I would talk to people about this they didn't even know that LinkedIn had events and they didn't even know that you could get people's emails from the LinkedIn event like they didn't even know that this was possible right so they had really really low awareness about it and so then then you need to you know now after you decide what level of the awareness Spectrum on you're on you have to decide what level of the demand capture versus demand generation Spectrum you're on sock 2 compliance is very much a demand capture offer it's not like you can just walk up to somebody and say Hey you know uh I know maybe you weren't thinking about getting sock to compliant today but would you consider it that's not really going to happen uh the goals of the organization are going to shift and they're going to say all right now we need to get sock to compliant uh we are losing too many Enterprise deals it's time to get it done right and so then when you email them when they've decided those goals you're going to be in a really good spot and you're going to be able to capture that demand so on the flip side you have demand generation where if you know nobody was waking up and saying oh I really want to run a LinkedIn event today but if I explain to them oh hey you know we've got this LinkedIn event strategy we can help build your list the cost per email is turning out to this you know would you want to talk we can generate that Demand right and so sometimes demand capture versus demand generation also goes along with the awareness but sometimes it's it's completely different and so um you know like manufacturing companies they they have an issue with the so it would be demand capture if you have a warehouse and you are cold emailing e-commerce stores that need warehousing space they know that warehousing space exists but they don't know that your warehousing space exists and they don't know that your warehousing space exists and it's right next to the port and it's super easy to get you know uh shipments to them they don't know that it's available right so that's an example where it is still demand capture but it's low awareness they don't know that you exist and they could really use you but it could be the wrong time because they they have contracts with all these other warehouses right and so then demand generation when there's High awareness uh probably could go back to the email valid validation thing I know that email validation tools and email finding tools exist but if you hit me with some good copy about how yours is the same quality as other tools and it's cheaper you know you're going to generate my Demand right I I'm I'm always in the mood to look at an email finding tool and so you know this is super important follow those guys for that stuff um you know I I definitely wanted to include it and talk a little bit about that and then the so the hardest thing thing for me to put this together that was stopping me the most was this campaign overviews part so I actually put together our best campaign from the year so it was when we did Outreach for Forbes and we got three leads so for every three leads we reached out to we got one positive response and our worst campaign oh whoops for every 5,000 leaves we reached out to we got a positive response and this was for cyber security and so I wanted to show the difference uh between the two of them and then after that we also have all of the campaigns that I have data on we ran probably three times as many campaigns as this last year uh but I deleted them and I don't have the data anymore and I didn't want to just make stuff up and so here we have 60 something campaigns all scored and put in and I have a description of everything and yeah this is probably the most interesting part of this entire document this is the benchmarking part that I was talking about so the average that we see as far as say open rate right keep growing up average open rate that we see was 52% this was really because some people had you know 60 to 70% open rate is really good open rate and then sometimes some people had bad offers and they were really dragging down our average um and then the average lead per positive response was 329 uh for the data that we have I don't want to say that we're such an amazing agency um you know that we were doing this for everybody because you even see Nick Abraham here he's saying that if you get one lead for every 375 people you reach out to that's what he has in his agency um I will say that our data skews lower possibly because I deleted all of the bad campaigns most likely like why would we keep them on so I I do want to call myself out for that but um anyway I wanted to present this document to you if you're still here after 32 minutes thank you I really appreciate it uh but so with that being said I hope you learned something from this I hope you got uh some you know idea of the way that we run things I also hope that something came up from you and you're like hey Eric you didn't mention this thing in your document you know do you want to talk about it I'm always open to talking on DMS and things like that so you know thanks guys for watching the video\#\# Date Posted:

\# How to Automate Cold Email Copywriting with Chat GPT

hey everyone in this video I'm gonna go over how we are using GPT 3.5 and gpt4 in order to automate uh not only the creation of outbound copywriting but also to personalize all of those emails as well and all that we need to start is just a company's case study and the website of the company that we're going to be writing copywriting for so I'm going to go into this workflow what I will preface with is a lot of times when I make these kinds of videos people are always asking me for the prompts um these prompts are very very intense I'm going to go over a couple of them in detail but after that I I cannot support giving out these prompts so I do apologize about that but I will go over a couple of them that are important in detail and so step one in order to getting all this done in my opinion is we need to get just a template copywriting of what is the like General message that we want to send and once we have a general message that we want to send we can then put it into a different prompt where we can personalize the Outreach based on what is true about the company or what we found about the company so we just have to enter a website into this column right over here and then we use the scrape website feature to scrape the content of the website and so uh usually we'll get all of the content but if the content is super long we'll just get the company description and it just picks between the two the first thing that we do is we build an idea we use gpt4 to build an ideal customer profile of the company and this is someone that it looks like um you know we're saying that they target mid to large companies in certain sectors and this is their buyer Persona and sometimes it even names them um as well Sophia HR executive and it talks about all of this stuff as well the prompts in here um is pretty intense Jordan Crawford actually wrote this system prompt so if you want to stop and screenshot it uh you know all credit to him and then I just basically asked for three buyer personas about the company then what I want to figure out is just more information about the company what do they do who like how are they better there than their competitors what are companies usually doing to solve this problem if they don't use this solution and so again we have a huge system prompt here and then we have the uh answers down here and so this is exactly what we want to solve for what is the problem this company solves without this company how would people be doing this what is something new or novel we can teach the person what is the cost of an action how is this company different from competitors so then we get all of this done uh here so now after we scrape the website we have an ideal customer profile format and then we have uh more information about the company just from all of this information now we get to the actual email writing and so in the email writing I'm not going to go over all every single one of these uh Integrations is writing an email I'm not going to go over all of the prompts I'm just going to talk to you about the differences in the prompt and we're just going to go over the first one and so in the first one uh we have a pretty large system prompt and uh this is actually somebody else wrote this named Edward and so uh I can't totally show that because that is his stuff but other than that we're basically saying hey write a persuasive persuasive message to a prospect given the information about the company this is information about uh uh about the company that we're reaching out to actually we should probably fix this this is information about the company we are reaching out to and then company description this is coming from the competitive intelligence over here and then this is a description of the ideal customer profile uh so then then we enter the case study over here so ideal customer profile goes in here and then we have the case study and then we just give it some rules and then we give it examples so I filled out an example and then I wrote one of the emails and then I filled out another example and then I wrote another one of the emails so the output looks something like this uh you know I saw your team's impressive uh recent growth and I couldn't help but wonder if prospecting time is becoming a burden allow me to show that we helped an outbound sales team automate their manual research enabling them to focus exclusively on selling considering that savings uh in time and resources would you be open to discuss how clay would similarly assist your team's aggregated data from 50 plus sources could dramatic dramatically on your prospecting process so is this perfect no is this 80 done and I could fix this in two minutes of editing yes and that's mainly the goal that I'm trying to get here I'm doing this very much in a stepwise function so now we have email one over here the next thing that we do is we use gpt4 to make suggestions about how email one could be better or this first email could be better so we get these suggestions written out and it says you know suggestions for this email one two three four five six we had a bunch of like um I think it's just up to five is the things that I had it checking for so then we uh do we have these suggestions and then we have this column where it's literally gpt4 editing gpt4 is what I call it where we're literally saying hey this is the message edit it with this criteria here and then we get the output so we'll read the same one notice your team's growth uh congrats this could mean your team spends more time prospecting and selling at clay we've helped teams like past clients name great we'll fill that in uh freeing their time for manual research and focusing on selling with our solution your team could experience similar uptake leveraging 50 plus data sources interested to chat about how clay can optimize their change process a little long kind of interesting maybe I like the first email better but you know that's just the way it is and so now we have all these variations so one two three four five six all of these variations every single one of them is just for email one because I kind of know that I really can't trust this to really write the whole message I just want as many options to choose from as possible so I can combine them all together quickly edit them and then pick out my favorite one and that's all I really want to do and so for this variation we've prompted to highlight the cost of an action remember in competitive intelligence we got the cost of an action done so over here we just prompt it more heavily to highlight that cost of an action so we're we're more attacking the status quo of what they're currently doing in this integration we're highlighting the case study we're putting more weight on the case study and we say hey like really drive home the the points of the case study here in this variation we are talking about a Competitive Edge so here we're highlighting how we are better than competitors and uh people should really be using the tool because of you know how we do things differently than competitors and this one I just gave it far more examples in the other ones I think I gave it two examples and in this one I gave it four examples and then those were all pretty generic examples when I say generic examples they followed like a base template of hey this is why I'm reaching out to you um like poke the bear type question slash um you know a tie-in between how we helped another customer case study and then call to action that's generally what we wrote then here I give creative campaigns where we're doing other things with AI and see how I even put in like the AI generation and all these custom variables so that I just wanted to see what gpt4 would come up with if we just let it rip a little bit more so I give it more examples about some creative uh campaigns that I've come up with where it isn't all filled out but it uses better language then I just did it with a value-based call to action basically I want to know you know just get an idea of something to offer for free to just provide value up front to the uh Prospect and so in in this flow yes you might have seen it we do have eight different variations of email one and that is very much by Design I assume over time I'll start deleting some of these because I'd find that some are better than others but right now as soon as I have an idea for a variation of email one I'm just putting it into action and then uh no sequence would be uh complete without follow-ups and so usually I find that I follow up in three different ways um one is I whatever case study I mentioned in the first email usually we just dig deeper in the second email and we talk about hey you know those people that we were talking about in the first email this is you know we we dive deeper in and we're like these three ways is particularly how we help them so this follow-up does precisely that it ingests the email that we sent before and then I still remind it about the competitive analysis and the ICP and um then we still give it the case study and we write a follow-up email given like you know three things about how we help the other company here again for follow-up two we're highlighting the cost of an action where we're just like really driving home like hey if you don't take action on this like this could be the potential cost that you could see and then for follow-up three this is just a very short to the point email like you can see like ever wondered how improving your recruitment process could speed up your growth we recently used our head hunting methods to fill all vacancies for our client within two weeks vastly improving their operations just like very short to the point just get it out there and then we have email three which follows a lot of the same rules I could probably do the same thing for email three as what we're doing with email one but basically the big difference here is that email 3 just uses a different case study in the input so that we can get a different email generated uh for that and I even think um I talked about yes so there's basically three kinds of offers where you're either helping somebody save money you're helping them get more money or you're helping them save time and so I also told it hey you know whichever one we mentioned in the email the first email about how we could save them time or we can make them more money or you know we could save them money uh whichever one we mentioned like let's try to go into a different direction is the the other thing I've done with email three here and so very much I am not trying to claim that I have figured out like a full end to end like I'm ready to hit go on all these sequences my whole goal here is to just get 80 of the way there and so this being considered now what we can do is we can take this copywriting and after we take this copywriting we can say okay hey this is this is the best email that I want to send this is the one and then we can take it to another clay workflow where now we have all of our prospecting data about all these companies we have valid email addresses we've run a more deeper analysis on them and now we want to use that deeper analysis in order to influence the messaging that we're going to be reaching out with and so what we can do here now is I can now say hey given this template edit this template so it's very relevant to the person that I'm reaching out to here's the information about the person that I'm reaching out to right and so this message I'll show you the prompt over here too where we're saying you know I'm going to provide you several inputs in order to rewrite a message um here's the message that needs to be edited edit this message with the data points and then I give context on the data points I'm like this is the the company sells to these job titles great uh this is the description of the company and you know we know that this company is growing their sales team because scr joined in the last six months you know and then I constrain its creativity a little bit over here with like if one of the inputs is empty ignore it and work with what you have and like all this other stuff then I wrote examples of it myself of what I would write given data being true about a company I only give it two examples I could improve this by giving it more um and changing the prompt around a little bit but basically you can see um if this says true that means that all three inputs that we're looking for were filled out so this should be the best version of the message and then false is going to just have a couple of the things filled out which it still should be a pretty good message and so the original message that we started with is just um uh it's actually just an okay message like I didn't even pick a great one first name I saw your team's impressive grocery recently yet I couldn't help but wonder if prospecting time is becoming a burden allow me to share what we helped an outbound sales team automate their Millennial research enabling them to focus exclusive on selling considering the savings and time resources would you be open to discuss how clay could similarly assess your teams our aggregate data from 50 plus data sources could dramatically streamline your prospecting process that's the base email and so now when we feed data into this email this is what it would look like uh congratulations on bringing Christopher Franco onto your sales team with your commitment to aiding teachers through class Technologies I understand prospecting instructors teachers and Educators efficiently is crucial clay could save your team valuable time by automating the outbound research process this could give them more opportunity to focus on promoting essential services including your excellent new Zoom tools which is that's just great it got it from the company description would you like to discuss how the aggregation of data from 50 sources could boost your prospecting experience and so even in this email there's like a couple things that I would change like I would probably talk a little bit more about how we helped another company and give it a better case study but I don't give a huge case study in the other in the previous email so that's fine and then maybe we would shorten up this call to action but all things that we can totally fix but otherwise great email right I noticed Sage's pioneering security work in otit and Cloud sectors awesome as you're expanding your sales team congrats to Nicholas Brown that's great that it did it like that are you considering ways to optimize outbound research we specialize specialize in automating just that freeing team sales uh freeing sales teams for what they excel in selling by leveraging data from 50 plus sources we could drastically simplify and accelerate our interactions with all these titles awesome could we connect soon to discuss this more in detail unless the people of YouTube disagree I think that's a great email let me know why you would say that's not an email I mean yeah there's things that we can tweak about it but like this is all just prompting and I could have started with a base of like a better base template so anyway so now this one remember we don't have all three of the data points filled out only two of the data points I filled out in this one uh I see that inverterland works meticulously with Warehouse managers operations managers and Logistics directors helping make Logistics process automation uh efficient and reliable combining this with your team's growth I wonder if the task of outbound research seems exhaustive sometimes we've helped teams streamline this process ensuring their focus remains on selling our tool calls data from 50 plus data sources easing their workload could it be valuable to explore how we could similarly support your growing team great so it didn't even have all the data and it's still able to create something like that let's try another one where we did have all the data I admire your work in promoting a more Global Workforce with your gross with your growth namely Kelly bowling joining your team recently have you been burdened with outbound prospecting we have experience helping sales teams like yours cut down manual research for CFO CEOs and HR managers that's great why not give your team uh more time to focus on what they do best selling our tool automatically collects collates data from 50 plus data sources could we chat about how we might be able to do this more efficiently so again if we were to make the template better I can already see ways that this would be better like it seems like the value prop that it keeps driving home is the 50 plus data sources instead of the automation of the workflow which we could just change in the template it's not that big of a deal and um but yeah this is just another thing that I've been working on in order to first get the template right and then be able to change that template depending on who we're reaching out to and as always thanks for watching the video and uh let me know what you think if this is going to be available via a form I will not like I said I can't give away the prompts because to be honest it's just too much work and and I'm not going to support that um but you know pause the video and take a look at the prompts that I did show uh that should answer a lot of your questions but uh yeah let me know if this was useful\#\# Date Posted: 2025-01-01

\# Changes in Outbound from 2023 to 2024

hey everyone I know it's been a long time since I posted a YouTube video and so it's been because we're working on a lot of things for 2025 namely being able to launch campaigns on behalf of customers for absolutely free and within 15 minutes and that's been the biggest thing that I've been working on the other thing I'm working on right now is this document that you're looking at right here is our gex wrapped 2023 document and I'm currently working on the 2024 document now this document I tried to write down as much as I could about outbound uh last year and it ended up being about 50 pages the current document I'm putting a lot of effort into right now the current document is at 90 pages right now too so I'm definitely adding a lot into it I thought it would be fun I actually haven't read this doc since maybe Midway through the year and I wanted to react to this doc uh as if well no I'm just going to react to this doc with everything we've learned since then I probably still stand by a lot of these things in this Doc and I'm basically going to take this in update anything in the 2024 version that we have coming as well too and so uh just come on this ride with me and we'll just see what has kind of changed in outbound in the past year right and so uh growth engine campaign overviews yes I did this for transparency I think nothing is more important in the agency world is being transparent and then sobering up some benchmarks and I wanted people to be able to see our process so all still the same cold email is a private ads network if anything I believe this to be the case more than anything this year uh I I really think that I I've been talking to teams who manually send emails and they will manually send emails and they will still get response rates in the range that we get as well and I think more and more as cold email keeps getting harder outbound automation is going to become a bigger thing and you're going to have to start thinking about it as a private ads network instead of this channel where you used to email 10 people and three people would respond I think those days are are just basically over I think the the big thing for outbound is when I talk to teams who have really nailed outbound automation like the teams over at ramp.com I think the the main question for some people is okay if outbound automation works so well why do they still have sdrs and there's still a lot of things that sdrs need to be able to do but the SDR team on a per email sent basis will still outperform the conversion of the outbound Automation and there's a couple of reasons for that one is they're really great at account selection and there's just a lot of things that AI can't do around account SEL an account selection and so what I mean by that is really picking you know a really great company and manually reaching out to them because you heard about them on LinkedIn and then you can say something super awesome about them you know more power to the SDR that's a great thing for them to be doing really really tough for AI and for outbound automated systems to be able to do that and then the other thing too is since there's no additional cost to sending emails to the executive assistant and the CEO then that's why ramp is seeing the sdrs Performing better on a per email sent basis because they're just spending their time with higher Roi or more likely to respond people um but with that it's still obviously a great channel for companies like ramp.com they're investing more and more in it uh I I'm not sure if I can share how much they invest in it per year but it's more than any of you might think and so uh as we keep getting into that and response rates keep decreasing for for normal outbound campaign so just saying hey first name and then sending static text we're going to have to keep using AI we're going to have to keep using better data and it's going to become like your private ads Network more and more our process yep so we use a cold email infrastructure uh and then we'll talk about the lists and all of this so in 2023 yes we were sending 50 emails per day per inbox and putting two inboxes on each um campaign and so what I would say here the biggest difference is now we send 30 emails per day per inbox and we ramp to 50 if we have a good positive response rate um all of this math is still the same we don't have uh we don't track open rates anymore so we're really just looking for instead of checking for a really high open rate we're checking to see that the reply rate is above 1% overall not counting out of office messages um we have 5,562 email accounts on behalf of our customers okay that's cute we have 50,000 this year so it really really uh increased wow that's crazy yeah so we have 50,000 inboxes this year so it really drastically increased we're still using straight up Google inboxes those work the best for us uh we use superwave inboxes here and there and then we've been adding a lot more hyper tide inboxes into our stack and so that's basically what it's looking like here the big change that's not included in this right now is last year we kind of just setting up inboxes for people as we felt like we needed this year what we started doing was we started setting up batches of inboxes so if somebody said hey I want to send 500 emails a day we would start setting up batches of inboxes so that we could have say three batches of inboxes so the first batch all all three batches could send 500 emails a day the first batch was Google the second batch was hyper tide or superwave and then the third batch was back to Google as well and we would just use batch one just so everything else could continue warming up so by the time you start using batch two it didn't just go through a three-week warm-up it went through whatever an week warm-up or whatever it might be and then once we get to batch two that's when we set up even more Google inboxes uh as well to just kind of cover our bases so last year we were kind of just running guns setting up domains and then this year we're much more organized for anybody watching this video If you're not an outbound agency I would say if you expect to send a thousand emails a day keep 50% of your sending volume that you want to keep uh up to keep 50% always warming and don't touch it so you you're you're going to set up a infrastructure that can send 1,500 emails a day but you're only going to use a thousand just in case anything goes wrong you can rotate those inboxes back in as an agency we just see it as an insurance policy for our customers to just set things up so anyway that's just the the major difference uh that got created there this segmented list stuff I mean I love to say the more things change the more things stay the same this if anything just became more important in 2024 really segmenting this list I still believe your best email is email one and two you can add me fight me I don't care email one and two are your best ones even if you say oh I got them to respond on email 7 the amount of people who marked you a Spam is just crazy uh after that um I still like to send shorter sequences that's true this sequence structure we still do I I have a lot to say about campaign strategy that I've already written in the other doc that I'm going to save but generally this is what we still say end uh but there's a lot more coming in the 2024 dock this lower friction CTA we already asked them for a meeting on both of these uh going for with a lower friction CTA I totally agree with over here we've maybe taken the employee count thing out of this and then we'll just name two other people at the company but yeah that's that's still what we're generally doing over here as well too and then for your Tam I still agree with this you essentially want to reach reach out to your if you have a small Tam you want to reach out figure out your math so you could reach out to everybody once a quarter with a with one sequence so a three to four email sequence once a quarter is what we're generally aiming for um and that even if you have a big Tam you can scale up your volume that way as well too but that's generally how we're doing the math for these campaign angles and brainstorming problem stiffing definitely agree with this one we did this restaurant thing we just launched a campaign where we were helping a company with that does Google review reputation management funny way of saying that we just then found negative reviews on their Google my business page and then would say hey do you want to get rid of some of these negative reviews like this one and then we would uh summarize that one and that worked extremely well so what we were doing was we finding a problem we said hey we found this problem do you want to do something about it on a performance basis crushed like I think for every 50 people we emailed we got a positive response it worked really really really well these truly funny relevant campaigns I don't know maybe we just haven't really had customers that wanted to to roll the dice with this I I can't remember this year doing this a whole ton we we mainly stayed away from this one using AI to help a prospect Envision what using your product or service would be like for them so in this what we're basically doing is we're using AI to create three bullet points of what using the product or service would look like in their business I I believe so much more in this campaign Playbook this year now more than ever it works so so so well it's one of the first campaigns we run for all of our customers I I really love this campaign if you haven't checked out this video type it into your browser uh and leave this video and and go watch this video because I think it's one of our best uh templates that we've ever written only reaching out to people when specific factors are true okay so this we're basically looking for you know a golden ICP so multiple things being true about these people uh we still run this I would say most of the times it unless so I would say you could still run this what we found to be more the case it was really really tough to get lists together where say all five of these things in this list would be true and so then what we did instead was we started creating messaging just for the Demar record on their site being Incorrect and then other messaging for its being the first time they were founder other messaging if they have a technical background other messaging if they have a salesperson but no VP of sales other messaging for they hiring for more salespeople because we just found by the time you get all of this done you're only targeting a certain amount of people but if you make messaging for each of these it's it's relevant enough where you could still get an increase in response rates but email far more people so we have a higher Roi on the campaign final point on this will you get a higher response rate if you put all of these five things together yes but is it going to be five times better or whatever the magnitude would be versus just one of these things no so we're we started uncoupling uh this golden ICP and like stars aligning campaign and we didn't do it as often in 2024 extremely relevant case studies yes everybody should be doing this we use ocean. and Panda match to find lookalike companies I really believe in the look like play it's one of the first campaigns again we run for all of our customers and when you're running a cold email campaign you are hypothesizing that I think this company is going to be interested in this message and when you run a look likee campaign you remove all of that and you just say okay I know that this company looks like one of our past companies so it'll be relevant to them and I don't have to guess on what the messaging is going to be because this is exactly what the customers said that they love about what our work with them and so I really ju I I think everybody should be running these campaigns and investing in software to help you run more of these campaigns influence our audience targeting I would say so I I put this in the 2024 doc the trigger of the year in my opinion is social engagement triggers whether they posted on LinkedIn about something or they engaged with the post about something this is by far the best trigger that you could be using clay helps you do this somewhat but trigi has become such an awesome platform for us that I would definitely check them out this I still recommend this to everybody but if anything I it it's easier to do you could do it more at scale with trigi and it's just awesome to be able to do Great lead magnet I'm never not going to be a fan of this the only reason it's tough to talk about is because every business has a different lead magnet for us like I said I've been working for the last two months on being able to launch a campaign for somebody in 15 minutes uh just on a call and so that's what I've been spending a lot of time on and we're going to shift talking about outbound services and we're going to be talking about how we can launch campaigns for people for free and in 15 minutes and get results within three days so I'm practicing what I preach here and we're going to having a different lead magnet as well too being genuinely useful of course two sentence email straight to the point I would say that we did a lot of this as well too this this was one of the things on this list we did a lot of for sure this flash roll thing I I tried doing this more so in 2023 and I would say in 2024 we didn't really do a whole lot of this read you pause the video and read up on what I'm talking about here but we didn't totally do a lot of this in 2024 I must admit all right let's see my copyrighting tips keep the email shorter than 100 words yep I would agree 75 is even better but y stay away from span wordss cool clearly communicate the reason you're reaching out kind of obvious Reddit fifth grade level cool make the message about them not you cool use social proof that is quality quantitative results in it I mean I basically agree with everything we're going to add more tips in the campaign strategy section in the new Doc but of course I agree with everything here still agree everything I say in this subject line section I completely agree with everything we haven't changed this now the biggest thing that I added to the 2024 document was we will start split testing now the normal subject lines that everybody loves to hate quick question question for first name company name connecting with company like or the little bracket thing I don't know like this not that we'll do that as well um so we we will split to those normal subject lines against a two to three-word subject line that uh would make them think it's coming from a colleague or a customer and we just see which one kind of performs better we're mainly keeping our eye on the reply rate these days though because we don't track open rates so yeah this preview text if anything I've been thinking more about preview text in the last year uh so that text that they'll get when they open up their uh their inbox on their browser or on the push notification on their phone I'm constantly thinking about how can we manipulate that to get the best open that we possibly can cool I I don't know yeah I guess no I still agree with this uh I think there's a lot of advice on LinkedIn of people saying you know you got to go with a really soft based CTA and could we send them more information or is this something you're looking into right now about this I I found that um if they're interested you can go for it and just get a a hard CTA we use a hard CTA asking people for time all the time and uh maybe I don't explicitly say would you want to hop on a call about this we say more of these things but asking for people for their time it works great poke the bear love it still I think everybody should be poking the bear go for it uh all right analogies this is one thing that I would want to just say we've totally killed this line uh the reason I killed this line is one I first thought that this line would crush and the and the way I found out that it didn't crush is because any other AI email generation that we would make people would say in the email how much they loved that we did our research and that we took it time to write an email and all these things when we sent a AI generated analogy in an email we never got somebody to say something back that was negative but we never got anybody to say something back positive either so we just didn't we just don't use this anymore using their last job as a call out we still do this not totally often but we still do it um the more I learn about your company I I we don't do that anymore just because when I thought thought of this I think Ai and email was still nent that people people would still respond back to me this was my feedback loop people would still respond back to me and say oh thanks for following up again I really appreciate you're doing research on our company and we just started not seeing that so we took that out we didn't really do that in 2024 \[Music\] um this we still do 100% focusing focusing on customers line totally still do this is any of this interesting so you can spend more time working with Fitness enthusiasts totally still do that I think it's great I think anybody could be adding that into their campaigns one thing as I say with AI all the time is somebody should be able to look at the workflow you have built for your AI in cold email and they should not get any value from it there are some things that you could totally still use and I think anybody could take advantage of this customer types line and like the the creative ideas line oh not that wherever it is like these I think anybody could take advantage of these things so anyway I I don't totally mean there that nobody can use it this I still believe in Creative value proposition are looking to help this totally still believe in I think you should pause the video and read this section this is this is super true what can you say in an email that your competitors can't say totally agree with this handling objections totally agree with this let's look at our copyrighting examples I think that's more important sell to job titles looks like like trying to help now what we're doing is we instead of this line today what we're now doing is we're using Cent to find the case study and how they helped the case study um nothing wrong with this line I think I would still use it I just don't love that it's two sentences and the case study now is one uh this I still love doing This Love This Love This okay cool as you're helping people yep I would still do that creative ideas love it cool we still do a lot of these things I don't think I would send this email anymore saying you know I sent you an email a while back with the subject outbound Edge maybe I you know what maybe I would because what I'm trying to get is when you first see that preview text it looks like they missed an email that was important because a salesperson usually doesn't send something like that um but anyway oh this tactic okay this tactic has changed a lot um so I used to do this and now what I would say is I wouldn't do this anymore so there's there's a couple things that I wouldn't do about this so one it looks like your sales team has seen a percentage change in the past three months that doesn't look human and people would see that and the it it just doesn't look human like no human has ever said that and it was a complete oversight for me to to do that so um what we now would do is I would say it looks like your sales team has like grown with the addition of and then we would name people uh and then we'd actually name people who joined the company recently so that's how I would change that your LinkedIn company account has gained number of followers in the past three months the other change that I would manipulate here is and probably in this line too is now whenever we are using data and we're saying hey we know this about your company now in 2024 what we started doing is we started citing our sources because what we'd often find is and these aren't great examples because people can't really fight with us about these but we would say hey it looks like you have 52,000 website visitors a month on your website and then people would email us back and and I literally had a person email me back and say is the point of this email to be so wrong that you get a response and I was like all right sorry man whatever so now what we'll do is we will um site our sources so I'll say Harmon . told me that your account your LinkedIn company account gained this many followers in the past three months and then the company looks like it has number of sales people with sales in their title based in the United States today link sales Navigator told me the company has this many people with sales based in the United States today and so anyway still these kind of things now with this whole campaign we're talking all about building customer workflows for them and outbound research and all that I would just lean on the free test we've been getting great results with the free test and we'd probably just do that this oh my God this this email so hard to pull off but I still love this email really really hard to pull off but I love it um Tapo so one of your recently linked post seems like the last time you posted yep I would still send this email today still would send this email today still would send this email today I would maybe just cut email four and send more emails of one two and three but uh just the reason I love this it's just super super relevant to what Tapo is offering with LinkedIn automation so um this I would never send this email ever again never never never never I just I just wouldn't send this first line ever again I would lean into the case study thing that we were talking about here I would I would use clent to find case studies and talk about the case studies are taking some of the digital real estate oh I still like this companies like competitor are taking some of the digital real estate keywords in space your company ranks for we could do that now we just have the capability with further data enrichment to actually send some company research uh over to them so I would probably manipulate this whole email and actually send them competitor insights instead of just talking about giving them a competitor Insight cool I think one thing I want to talk about the creative ideas campaign is I used to just let the AI come up with the creative ideas and if you're familiar with the creative ideas campaign you'll know what I'm talking about but basically we're going for one campaign or one bullet point well we're going for three bullet points with different ideas in 2024 what we started doing was having an opinion about which what bullet point should say what so we would say this bullet point should talk about this this bullet point should talk about this and it turned into way more relevant um AI generated bullet points so I I just remembered that I thought I'd put that in there cool again with this I would do I would do more to show them what we found and not just tell them about what we found cool and I would still I mean great like FAL email that's totally fine this I mean I still totally believe for people who say that GPT does increase your response rates you just haven't tried to write GPT or you need a different offer I totally still believe in all of this recent fundraise open jobs big change that we made with open jobs we used to say hey it looks like you're hiring sdrs now we'll say I saw in the job post for the SDR are it looks like they're going to be responsible for thing we're using the job description of the post a lot more recent new hire great trigger everyone should use tech on site in the past year we started using tech on site to basically run three kinds of campaigns one to say hey you're using our competitor and you should switch to us because we're better two an Integrations campaign so saying hey you already used HubSpot we ingree with hubot wouldn't be so great if you use us and then three um using a tech installation as just a level of intent so if a company has installed Zoom info clearbit and rbb you know they really care about account research or I mean ABM campaigns or website deanonymization whatever you want to say in that regard and so then we we won't even say anything about the tech we just use it to say hey we know that these people have a lot of budget to spend and we're going to Target them and we don't necessarily need to put it into the copy we definitely updated this you could see a new video on my channel but we definitely updated the local business uh prospecting channel uh strategy the clearbit campaign setup I would say nobody has asked us for a clearbit campaign setup everybody's asking for a warmly setup or an RB Tob setup nobody's asking for Clear bit anymore this we still do I love this campaign this we use recent company news we use but we used to use predict leads a lot of for the data now we're just using Cent yep we still do this depending on the company um Target people that never have never held a position before we can still do this we just don't do this that often since by the time you shake out all the data it's just not very likely that you're going to grab people but we still we still do this we just don't do it that often employee headcount growth increase we use this as an intent Target uh competitor clients yep with the technographic data like we talked about Target people that used to work at your customers and move to New jobs love that campaign if you have a large enough customer list you should absolutely be doing that companies with shared investors obviously no dedicated team members for a task yep still do that one these trigery Scrapy and no I guess triggery and scrap Le make this way easier to do this check out scrap Le scrape lii uh is great for doing this look like yep we still use ocean testing multiple angles and stacking them in one campaign oh yeah we totally still do this I love doing that let's see demand capture and demand yep we still talk about this cool and then we've benchmarks going in here and uh so the only thing I might say about benchmarks is we definitely saw an increase in the amount of emails you had to send in order to get a positive response in 2024 but that's normal we'll just keep on seeing that probably who knows this year we might even see it level out with all the spam filter changes that are coming we might see more people exit the cold email game and then there won't be as much volume sent and we might see kind of a stagnant year for responses or I mean it might still go up who knows um but we'll see and so I hope this was enjoyable we've got a lot of content coming the main things that I'm working on right now is finishing our 2024 doc which you could see uh oh nope you can't see a preview of that because the loom is on only on this tab so I'm finishing that up and then we're going to be making a lot of content I think a lot of my content has been around tutorials and how to do things and I want to make more tutorials but then include examples so that you could do it yourself for as cheap as possible so instead of just watching the video you could actually get your hands in it and do it I think that's a big thing that's missing in the space right now so uh anyway thanks for sitting with me if you got to the end of the video drop a comment because I really really appreciate when you guys sit here and watch a 27 minute video with me um and even though it's not about this I'm thinking about naming this video I don't know we'll see something about I was wrong in 2023 I got this wrong in 2023 I don't know we'll put something in there but now I'm rambling I just really appreciate you guys thanks so much bye\#\# Date Posted: 2024-05-01

\# Lead Magnets That Anyone Can Send

hey everyone uh this video I just wanted to do about lead magnets because by far the best campaigns that we've ever send for cold email all have lead magnets so basically the best campaigns are the ones where people give something in order to get something and I have a lot of customers who struggle with coming up with lead magnet ideas so today I just tried to think deeply about how can you create a lead magnet essentially from nothing uh and I'm going to talk about why and I might you know talk a little bit too much in this video but who knows and so first what's the problem right I work with a lot of software companies and sometimes their time to value is extremely long and the problem that that creates is the only way that you can really get value from their software product is if you integrate it with your Erp system you integrate it with your CRM you integrate it with your um hris system you integrate it with slack like that you after you integrate it with everything then you can start getting value and so it's really tough for them to have a free trial of their product because they sell to Enterprise it's really tough to have a free trial of their product it's really tough to you know do kind of audits because they deal with really highly sensitive information it's it's just difficult to have a lead magnet for them and so I wanted to think about Frameworks that you can use to brain storm your own lead magnets uh so if you're working with growth engine X we could you know do this with you or if you're just watching the YouTube and getting value here then you know this is how we can think about it and um I I'm kind of in an interesting position where my best lead magnets are just lists I love emailing people and literally just saying hey you know we could help you you know build an account list do you want you know 10,000 accounts scored for whatever criteria you want and then people basically just respond and they say yeah I want a list of these companies blah blah blah and we like I can also make inboxes for free for people I can you know do a copyrighting session with people like there's a lot of things that we can do in order to get people's attention um probably the best lead magnet we've ever sent is we've offered to we found people who are posting on LinkedIn and we said hey I saw your last LinkedIn post considering you post a lot if I were to grab the last 10 people who engaged on all your posts and find their email addresses uh would that be useful to you and people you know loved that we we would get tons and tons and tons of responses on that and so the um now I I say this because a lot of people are still sending emails of hey like would you want to book a demo and it's it's like yeah booking a demo is cool but um if you can give something if you can tell your prospect hey if you have a call with me this is what you're going to get in return that's the best kind of email that you can send and so um this is going to be a hypothesis that again I might look back in six months and a year and think this is crazy but I'm just trying to work out how any company could send a lead magnet even if you don't necessarily have a lead magnet to send and so if you're still watching this and you're like what do you mean by a lead magnet let's get into the doc I know I've had it up the whole time but basically a lead magnet is a micro offer so it's how you can help somebody save time save money or make more money uh but you do it for free so it's something that can lead into your overall one and it just gives you a taste of what it's like to work with this person so if I called email people and like I said I give free account lists out and I say hey you know I'll get 10,000 companies and I'll score them for whatever you want then you know we can send those out and people you know they find Value and and the reason I do 10,000 is because people know that there like other companies are charging for that and I'm going to give it to them for free right so the best lead magnets are things that you can offer for free that show your value and um the prospects know other people are chared for and you're giving away for free um if you want more information about this definitely read $100 million leads by Alex Heros the best book on thinking about these things and I'm drawing a lot of um the content on this from there because he just explains it the best and so um like I said a lot of companies though they have a tough time coming up with these lead magnets and so usually when you're giving somebody lead magnets you're usually giving them some kind of Leverage and you gain leverage through media Tech or actual services so other people's time software or media right and so media is sometimes the easiest way to you know do a lead magnet but oftentimes people don't totally care about the the media and so what I mean by that is like nobody's really going to watch your like 35 minute webinar unless the webinar is super super super awesome and so if you're going to have a media lead magnet I actually highly recommend posting them on social media and seeing which one performs the best and do it in a um request for content and you receive content style so if you post it on Twitter or you post it on LinkedIn and you say hey just comment on this and I'll send it to you that way you can really gauge like how many people actually want the content because um you know your 35 minute webinar people might not care about but if you made content around like you know here's the exact Tech stack we use and the process to get it all set up to send 1.5 million cold emails per month yes that's media but people are charging for that in their courses and I could also test like how people want that on social uh a big thing with media ones is if you can't get people to want it for free you know who follow you no way people are going to want it on cold email right so um media is a it's a tangible lead magnet where you actually have something to give somebody right and so um hopefully you have something to give somebody but maybe you don't and then Tech is like a free trial so if you have a free trial of your software great so like another kind of tech that I like to give people access to is sometimes just spreadsheets just because if you sign up for a free trial you're like you know signing up and you're going to get their emails and you got to try their product and you know yeah I don't know people might feel a little bit manipulated on something like that um well manipulated is not really the right word but it's like of course you want them to get a free trial but if you have some kind of ungated that's that's the better thing that I'm thinking about ungated tech and actually we should change this whoops oh my gosh ungated Tech is really what I mean so we have for instance we have an automation that automatically updates DNS records for uh the domains and the inboxes that we set up right and if I were to send to somebody and say hey so you have a bunch of SRS on your team cold email is getting a lot harder you have to set up all these secondary domains we have an automation that does all the stuff for you would could we just send it over for you great like then then now we have all like we can just give it to them it's not in our free trial it's not you know any of those things we could just give it to them and it's not gated all they have to do is just say yes and then service is you know the hardest one especially for SAS companies to to do and so by service it's like me going out and scraping people's last 10 LinkedIn posts for all the people who engaged in the content right that's a service that that we could provide for somebody we could do it for free it has a very small scope of work but it's very valuable you know all this stuff and so I would say these are examples of the top lead magnets but you have to have something prepared for all of these things right and a lot of times when we're working with customers it's the first time they're thinking about lead magnets so I was spending a lot of time trying to think about what are lead magnets that you as just the founder of your company or a salesperson for your company could just offer people and you don't have to put a lot of things together now all of these intangible lead magnets they all technically follow fall under media don't get me wrong I I'm not you know if you're watching this video and you're like Eric these all sound like media they're all absolutely media but a lot of times I'm working with people and they say oh we don't have a PDF for that or you know it's going to take a long time to get a video created for or we don't have this content prepared in all these things that's not what we're going for here one it shouldn't take you that long but anyway let let's just put that to the side the whole point of this is if we email somebody and we say hey if you take a meeting with me this is what you're going to get in return all we're trying to do is we're trying to cross that Gap and if these are some intangible lead magnets and I say intangible because there's nothing actually to give them it is still though if you take a call with me I will do these things for you and you don't have to prepare anything beforehand you could just use the insights that you already have and so uh I just listed out a couple and hopefully these just give you ideas I'm going to spend a lot of time telling more stories about this than anything and um even though these are super quick I want to go kind of deep into them so one is you could just talk about your founding story so we worked with one company where they helped e-commerce Brands and they helped e-commerce brands with a very particular problem and they could successfully do this because they ran seven e-commerce companies so the message that we were sending for them is we were basically saying you know hey we know this problem really well because we've ran seven e-commerce Brands and I sold two of them if you ever want to talk about how we could help with this particular problem or if you just want to talk about how I sold my e-commerce Brands let's get connected so now we're kind of offering two things right is so one we're we're selling well one actually I guess it's three we're selling the actual offer of our solution and saying hey we can help with this very particular problem we're also selling the fact that we are experts on this problem and we've sold all of these other companies no well we've started all these other companies and we know how this you know works and we're in this world a ton and then we're also selling the fact that we sold our companies and we could talk to you about that and that's you know it's its own thing because you know a lot of people want to sell their company they have no clue how to do it blah blah blah blah what it really goes here is like why did you start the company and how is that important and so if you are a person who is coming from the industry that you're selling into so if you're selling to gym owners and you used to be a gym owner you can use that founding story and basically say hey I'm just like you I could talk about how I did some of these things that you might want to learn about about how I did it and this product here could help you do that whatever it might be so you can lean into your founding story and say I founded this company because I was just like you and when I was doing these things I had all these problems and so here's how we solved it so if you take a call with me I will share that with you and all of the scars that I got so that you can learn without paying the price right that's what I mean by founding story so that's a lead magnet that if somebody takes a call with you you can just um you can give them that story on the spot without preparing a ton of media to give them and all these things uh data we have across our customers that you don't have let's keep using a gym software example as well and so if you are a gym software company and you are selling to gym owners you might have insights about selling and getting new memberships and keeping memberships and all these things that they don't have that you don't need your Tech Team and your marketing team to come up with all this crazy great stuff you could say hey I've set up all these other strategies for other gyms I Implement these things all the time would you just want to talk about the couple of little tweaks in your current flow that we've seen work really well for people or you could get even more particular and you could say you know PS for instance we noticed that if you have a new person coming in and you give them an opportunity to book within 24 hours and don't let them book past than 72 hours it really increases show up rates and retention and things like that and you don't let people book a week in advance because they're going to forget about it blah blah blah if you know those things to be true then you could reach out to them and you say if you take a call with me you will learn about this data that we have about the market that you don't have right and that works outside of gym so if you've got like a Google ads SAS company and you know that a big mistake that most people are making with their Google ads is spending too much on branded keywords or or maybe it's not that spending too much money on competitive keywords and competitor keywords I guess I would say you have that data e-commerce Brands don't have that data give them the data right like that's that's the way that I'd be thinking about it right is what do you know about the market or the industry that your customers wish they knew and then you can go forward so for instance I mean this very video right now for our company I know that the people give more in an email get more responses hands down you can fight me on it like every single time if you can answer the question if you take a meeting with me what do I get in return for your prospects you will get more responses that's just the way that it is and so um anyway data and that you have that that other people don't have right like one piece of data that we have is a lot of people are worried about like well what's the perfect time to send emails this that and the other thing doesn't matter send the email you're thinking too much just keep going right so that's another thing um okay so another one it's a slight Twist on the data we have across our customers that you don't have but it's past successful customer strategies so in the past you know that customers would do something in order to increase their conversion rates and to increase customer success whatever it might be you can share those strategies with new customers and say hey here's how people do it so for instance we work with a marketing agency that's one of the high highest reviewed uh agencies on G2 and they work with a ton of great SAS companies and so we basically our lead magnet for them is hey if you book a call with me you will I'll just tell you a lot of the trends that are working right now for our past customers that you could just Implement on your own whether you work with us or not you'd be able to implement these things right and so you can apply that for a ton of things if you have a financial software like a financial planning software you could even go out and you could say hey everyone you know um here's a way that people are mixing Ai and judging the quality uh you know they're using AI to increase their financial planning but then they have this step in the process in order to completely make sure that it's accurate right so solving some kind of problem with some kind of strategy here right so that's another thing that you could do as well a little bit of like data we have across our customers that you don't have but it's also you know past successful customer strategies do you want to know how other gyms are opening up and increasing Revenue by $50,000 a month I could just tell you the story and you can implement it by yourself or we could do it for you whatever it might be I know that leans more towards service with that one so I'm not sure but if but if you sold like a software that automatically did that I mean they could take a shot at creating the automations who knows who's going to do that but anyway so that's uh that's another one audit and customer and competitor analysis a little bit similar so an audit I would say is like what are like giving them a free review of what they're currently doing today versus a competitor analysis they sound similar but let's just talk about the difference so if I were to come in and I were to say hey um I'm going to come in and I can audit your cold email sequence and I'll let you know if anything is not a best practice right now so for instance like people are sending seven emails in a sequence and we know that they should be sending three I can just jump in and see their sequence length and just tell them that they should be cutting it right and just doing that versus a competitor analysis where somehow if we were to get a hold of the cold email sequences that their competitors are sending then uh and look at theirs and then we can kind of copy and paste what everybody is doing right um so anyway that's just like uh so with an audit you could come in and you can see what are they doing today and how could they be doing it better and hopefully how can your software help them do that as well or how can your service or your product help them do that uh as well with the audit that you gave them um and you could do it in real time highly personalized High touch you know give them everything that you can versus a competitor analysis where you could say hey you know like on the call we could just review what I see about the competitors and I can tell you how you it seems like you stack up to them using our expertise you know all those things um okay personalized strategy session this is a little like I don't know actually I probably should have lumped this together with an audit and a competitor analysis um but basically what I was just going for here is it's a little bit different than an audit because if they don't have this in place right now I just wanted to to remind myself to basically say another kind of intangible lead magnet that you could give people is to say Hey you know even though you don't have this process in place I could draw out a strategy for you on a 30- minute call of how to you know put this process into place um so that's one way checklist is I mean this is a little bit of media because you're going to have to prepare a little bit of things but if you say hey I've got a checklist of all these things do you want to run through them together and on a call we could talk about it that's another thing that you could talk about industry bench marking a little bit of a combination of dat you have and the competitor analysis but this is just basically looking out into everything and telling people you know sometimes my customers come to me and they're like yeah if we get a 20% open rate uh we'll be happy and I tell them we're not happy at a 20% open rate because we know across this industry that you should be getting a 40 50 60 70 80% open rate shouldn't be 20 and it's just because they're using their Tech incorrectly that they're getting low open rates like that and they're getting in spam um if you're in my comments I know open rates aren't totally accurate but you know bear with me so industry benchmarking is a little bit of a comparison of competitor analysis and then data that you have where you can basically say like look we know all these things about the the industry you know could we share some of those things with you and then just a step further on that doing a future Trend analysis of you know as long as these things keep happening here's what I think is going to happen and here's how you can prepare for those things so for instance you know with Google tightening down on spam filters here's what we're doing for prepare for it it's just trending this way and here's the solutions that we are thinking about so instead of only opening up three domains we recommend setting up six and then just keeping some of them slightly warming and then we can move on to the other ones right and so um that would be like a future Trend analysis that you'd be able to do for somebody and how they should be taking steps today to prepare for the future that's coming and so I hope this was helpful uh as I really am trying to help people who have a tough time creating lead magnets um because they feel like they don't have anything that they can just give away for free you do have things that you can give away for free oftentimes there they insights and I hope one of these sparked another idea with you of some kind of insight that you can also give but then keep in mind that a lot of these insights are media as well so if you want to test any of these insights like I said oh this is a big thing too is you I almost forgot this part you want to test your lead magnets for interest before spending a lot of time building them we've had people spend you know internal engineering hours to build lead magnets for outbound campaigns and we're not even sure if they spend all this time if people are even going to request it so what we'll do is we'll change the copywriting so that we'll say like you know basically hey it's going to take a little bit of elbow grease but we could put it together for you just to see if we do automate this process if people would want it so I I'll just flesh that out completely for you so if you had like I said a Google ads you know platform that you know helped predict what ads were going to be the best ads and you wanted and your whole process it takes a long time you have to lot learn a lot about their industry and this that and the other thing but you wanted to test hey if you put in your product type I could just output some good Google ads for you but it's not built today you don't even know if people want that on outbound right now so what you could do first is you could just say hey you know it's going to take some elbow grease but if you tell me but I would use AI to write this message a little bit but if I were to do an audit on this industry in these with these kinds of products would you review it right so then you can test okay is this even worth automating right now because you know you could spend a lot of time and then people don't even care right and so um hopefully this helps somebody because the more you give in an outbound campaign the more you get and sometimes there's a Clear Connection of hey I can you know give people this in return and and sometimes it's valuable and sometimes it's not so a big thing that we also say is like do are are your competitors charging for this and I would say this is also in order of difficulty for tech companies I would say is media is really easy to put together but really hard to make valuable ungated Tech is a little bit tougher to put together but it's even more valuable and then a service is like the best thing that you could do I mean it's the hardest one to to deliver on because you're not scaling it but it's you could change it on the Fly and it's you know you could just modulate it as people need and you could go over Above and Beyond on some things where you see an opportunity and you can white glove it and those kind of things if you don't see a path with your current offer for one of these things then I would consider doing these things to basically be able to end your email answering the question I'm gonna say it again how do you answer the question to your prospect if I take a call with you what's in it for me that's the most important part of running a cold email campaign um and I used to think it was the data I used to think it was the AI personalizations and don't get me wrong we can go crazy making those today but it really is if I take a call with you what do I get in return so hopefully this helps somebody out there and if it doesn't maybe this video will get no views but we'll see thanks everyone\#\# Date Posted: 2025-01-01

\# How to Build a List for Almost any Target Market

what I'm going to go over today is a video that I wanted to put into our growth engine x uh wrapped 2024 doc that I'm working on currently right here and I'll be releasing this along with the video and I hope you're checking that out because I'm putting a lot of work into it what I wanted to do is I wanted to build exercises that went into list building and so that people would be able to see them and what it actually made me think that it's more important for you to see the fundamentals of how each of those lists are built then it is necessarily for me to sit there and say okay here's how we're going to find a list of marketing leaders at e-commerce companies or things like that and so this video I'm going to title it how to build a tam for anything because if you get all of these Concepts down you should be able to build out a Target addressable Market list for anything that you're trying to to look for and when I mean a Target addressable Market L of course I'm talking about a list of your potential customers that then you could then email but what I like to tell people a lot especially customers of growth engine X is that it is very easy to get 80% of a list it gets very difficult to get 100% of the list and so what I mean by that is just quick story we had somebody and they wanted every single atra company in the United States and so what we did is we scraped LinkedIn for all the data and then we went and we scraped all the data we could from D7 lead finder and then we set up a Google map scraper and we scraped uh every Google Map listing uh of every zip code with over 10,000 people in it and then they came back and I think we found like I don't know 140,000 HVAC companies and they said hey statista or the Bureau of Labor they say that there's 250,000 HVAC companies where are the other HVAC companies and when we are so fundamentally scraping the places that you can find these agac companies that is basically the list that that we have right so the only way that you'd be able to find more HVAC companies is by getting access to the government business database which is often does not have filters does not have tags it doesn't have anything that's going to be able to help you figure out if the company is actually an HVAC company or not and then you're gonna have to go through all that work it's not easy to scrape those things and you're it's it's going to be a lot of effort and you're not going to get that many more companies out of it so whenever we're building a targeted addressable Market we are more concerned with how can we get and make sure that we get as much coverage as we possibly can and the coverage that we do get is as high quality as possible the other thing is I don't know how the Bureau of Labor is getting these things but if you scrape Google Maps for every HVAC company that you could find and that there's at companies that aren't listed on Google Maps do you really want to be selling to them anyway and so that's kind of the the thought process that uh we put behind this and so I made this this pipeline that I think this basically covers most of the ways that we get our data and so I would still say that most of our data today contacts and companies is coming from the Apollo data set I'll be making a how to use all of these platforms and 2025 type videos uh for all these platforms Apollo is still our most used I say they go back and forth with clay for me of clay finding more companies and Clay finding more people and Apollo finding more companies and Apollo finding more people that we basically still start with Apollo because it's a little bit easier to pull out large uh lists and it's a little bit easier to manage who we've already contacted who we haven't so we start with Apollo the reason I love Apollo is because they have those industry filters but then they also have company keywords on top of the industry filters that I think they AI generate but then you could also pull company keywords from their uh social media descriptions as well as their SEO descriptions and it really helps you refine the list so a lot of times I know we have things feeding into this but Apollo is normally where we start with a lot of our data so for instance if you wanted a list of CEOs in the banking industry not a whole lot of extra work is going to have to go into that list we can just use the Apollo data set and then all you're really going to have to be concerned with is one cleaning up the titles and making sure that executive assistant to the CEO isn't inside of your list but then also if you use the banking industry filter inside of Apollo then you'll also run a problem uh where there's then going to be SAS companies in there and there's going to be consulting firms and those kind of things so you have to clean it up for companies that are actually Banks but Apollo would be able to get you all of your data and so then what we do is we will use other platforms to push data into aoll to find contacts and then when we get that we'll do more of our enrichment or more of our filtering inside of clay.com and then we're pushing it to Smart lead now this also is in consideration when your excuse me when your Tam has a really good LinkedIn presence if your Tam does not have a very good uh LinkedIn presence then we're going to be using D7 lead finder or appify so D7 lead finder gets their data uh from Google Maps and then with applify you can use a Google Maps scraper so you'd be able to scrape bunch of locations and things like that uh all within the platform and then that data we push to Clay and and I'll explain that a little bit but so if somebody comes to us and they say hey I want a list of companies that are e-commerce Brands and they're all using web flow then we would be using builtwith to initially build this list so and I know everybody has I still spelled buildt with wrong I know everybody has their opinion on builtwith and whether it's good or not and and all these things I would say the main thing that is a problem with builtwith is that they will say hey here's a list of everybody who's using this technology and then they'll include people who haven't used the that they haven't detected the company using that technology for over a year and they're just still on the list so you can fix most of the problems with the builtwith data by just using their um last uh last detected date filter in the builtwith report and you're going to be able to get that data and so whenever somebody says yeah I want marketing leaders at e-commerce brands that are using webflow we will build the webflow list in builtwith and then builtwith actually lets you build a list of companies that are using two technologies so we could even find people who are using Shopify as the checkout and then webflow as the website that's one way to do it you're going to get a little bit messy but so we could get the the builtwith with uh we could get the web flow list off of builtwith and then we can push that list into Apollo and we can just raise our chances of being able to find good fit companies by using their industry filter inside of Apollo we would be looking for retail consumer goods l luy goods Sporting Goods any kind of industry that has a high likelihood of being in e-commerce anyway and then we can use clay and Clay agent to further clean that up right and so builtwith is when you need to start with the technology and then you're going to push in Ocean I think ocean H has an amazing look like filter and so does panda match um ocean has an amazing look like filter and they have great company keywords as well too so when we need a really refined list of the list of companies ocean is where we go to and I would say the best thing for this is say we're looking for a list of insurance brokers that mainly deal with health insurance I think we'd be going to Ocean for this or for using it for local likes of some kind of website or something we'd be going to Ocean to find that data and the reason I like it is their company keywords have they have much more depth to them than the Apollo data does and then also ocean has industry filters that are just really great like they have a SAS industry filter that's a really common thing that we need to be able to do for our customers and Apollo doesn't have a SAS filter just out of the box they just use a company keyword for that filtering and so ocean has a really great SAS list in there crunch base similar thing I really like their industry filters in particular their SAS filter and then they also have the fundraising data built straight into the platform and so it's just really great to also have crunch base in your stack and then basically anything that let filter for just a list of companies and gives us a list of domains all three of these we are taking those list of domains and then we're putting them into Apollo and we're finding contacts in Apollo using their data set and if we don't feel like we found enough we'll use the clay data set as well too again this is when they have a really high propensity that the people you're looking for have LinkedIn profiles because that's where most of these data providers are getting their contact data is from these these LinkedIn profiles and then store leads when we're also just looking for e-commerce Brands as well we'll also be pushing in there sometimes we use manual scraping uh for instance you can really easily scrape Yellow Pages if you wanted to build a list of local businesses and it includes the website if you use instant data Scraper on Yellow Pages and you just make a search you would totally be able to do that and then push things into Apollo and then the only time that we're not really pushing things into Apollo directly is when we're getting the leads from D7 lead finder or appify uh just because then we're usually we're using D7 lead finder or we're using the Google Map scraper and appify to get businesses that most often don't have a person with a LinkedIn presence that in that case cayan is your best resource to be able to find these contacts there's another video I have on finding local business uh owners and contact information that you should check out if you want to see how we do that but that's why we're skipping Apollo in this instance because we are just pushing it straight into clay using clay jent to find the contacts and then pushing into smart lead and then also when we scrape sales Navigator we're using the sales Navigator scraper in clay and then pushing the data in there and so then we're not using Apollo because we're using Apollo to get the contacts I don't need the contacts anymore because I had got them from sales Navigator then we're just skipping the process then we're going into clay and so I'm just going to walk through a couple of examples now to these examples I went through some of our past customers and I thought okay these would be good to explain to everybody of the process that we do to to find these so that um you could see what I'm talking about and so I'm not going to build all of these I think I can explain them in enough detail for you to think about them if I ever think that we need to build any of them live I'll jump over into some of these tools but so one is a list of personal injury lawyers in New Jersey now the New Jersey part doesn't really matter um really the part here that's going to be difficult is the personal injury lawyers why well I think it can be assumed that Law Firm worth their salt is going to have a LinkedIn company page so we we're going to be able to get most of them with the clay data set or the Apollo data set and if we want it to go crazy we could do more of a Google Maps thing I I'm not too concerned about that if you wanted to just get a campaign started you would absolutely be able to use Apollo data and the the clay data inside of well the LinkedIn data inside of clay to be able to get started if you need every Law Firm then yeah I would start using the Google Maps data but so we're just going to get started with Apollo data right and now the part here that's difficult is the personal injury lawyers in New Jersey so Apollo might have a company keyword for personal injury but who knows if they ever missed it in a company if they just don't have keywords on a company whatever it might be so what I prefer to do in this case is I would far prefer to pull the as big of a list as I can from Apollo and then just only pull law legal services and law practice companies from Apollo and then pull them into a clay table and then I would use something like s.dev or clent to be able to figure out okay do they mention keywords on their website around personal injury or can cagent detect that they are a personal injury law form or can I get their SEO description and use Ai and ask do they deal with personal injury I would probably lean towards cagent with 40 mini on this one to be able to find that list but that's essentially how we would do it so in this case it's not that building the overall list is going to be difficult it's the or do these people actually deal with personal injury and I would be using serper dodev or Cent to be able to find those things and if you don't know what I'm talking about I have another video on serper dodev and then uh I have a lot of videos on cayan as well too but then clay University is an amazing thing that you should be able to check out but you'd essentially be able to do those things in there yoga studio in Florida okay so now this presents a different uh problem yoga studios do not often have a great LinkedIn presence and so we would be scraping from first we would use the Apollo data set just because if they do have any yoga studio owners in there let's just take it because it's just easy data let's just take it and we can just get started with that but so we don't have the the yoga studio data uh not every yoga studio is going to be on LinkedIn so we'll take what we can from AP Apollo the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to take what we can from D7 lead finder so I would personally take what I can from Apollo get all the company domains in a spreadsheet and then find as many company domains as I can in D7 lead finder and then put all those into a spreadsheet and then D duplicate against those now in D7 lead finder I don't know how this company has been around for over five or six years and they do not have this keyword thing down so in D7 lead finder if you search SE for yoga studios you will get funeral homes in your list so you just need to make sure they do give you the category of the company you need to make sure that before you do anything with the list you're making sure that it actually is a yoga studio in that category um and I found the categories to be pretty correct it's just for some reason funeral homes will still be in your list and you just need to clean that up then finally we will have the Apollo company list and then we'll have the D7 lead finder list if we need more than that that's when I'd go to app ify and I'd use their Google Map scraper um or I would go to Yellow Pages and I would scrape for yoga studios on Yellow Pages and I guess this is a good time for us to to bounce out but so if we go here and we say you know yoga studio and let's see what they even say okay cool yoga studio and then we can even put this as Florida and we can split up the the search and everything but see how it says geolocation terms equals Florida and if we were to change this to Miami we could easily just change this um we could recreate this URL if we really need to needed to and so now we can just use instant data scraper which you're not going to see instant data scraper pop up but it's this Pokeball thing and we can get instant data scraper to scrape all of these yoga studios for us um in Miami and so we got let's see 153 here if we're just doing Miami and then we have Florida I don't know why it's got all those options okay cool just Florida so there's 153 just in Miami oh what you just had yoga studios in Florida 1769 okay that sounds a lot better I would scrape all of these and I would get as many yoga studios as I possibly could and so then you'd also have to clean it up I would probably use Cent to clean this up as well too to just pull out all these and then you have the appify Google Map scraper as well use the one that's hosted by appify see this one's maintained by appify I always anytime I'm using an appify actor I like to use the ones maintained by appify so you actually have somebody that you can get some support from and so use this scraper and then you'd be able to pull out everything from Google Maps that you'd like as well too and this is you know basically how we would we would cover that founders of SAS companies okay so it's not difficult to find Founders uh of SAS companies because they're all going to be on LinkedIn you can bet that they're going to have really good coverage of them on LinkedIn the SAS company's part is the difficult part here and so I would either use crunchbase they have a SAS filter or I would use ocean they have a SAS filter as well too just cut to the Chase and just use those filters to just be a able to to find SAS companies right um and then there's this guy who's building a database of SAS companies called sassy DB you can check him out too and then there's also the now I'm forgetting what it's called somebody has a database of 28,000 SAS companies and I forget what they're called yeah but there's another company that's really easy to scrape uh their SAS company list and now I'm just forgetting what it's called I'm so sorry oh lka there it is it just came back to me as soon as I was going to get something like this lka lka SAS database Nathan lka let's see where is this thing cool so then you'd be able to get the SAS database from here as well too if you'd like and you could use instant data scraper to get it um but crunch base and ocean also have great lists for this as well too and so then we would get the list of SAS companies and then once we have the list of SAS companies we would break down that list we'd get the domains we'd find the founders in Apollo we'd find the the founders in clay and you'd be Off to the Races marketing leaders at e-commerce companies Okay so this sounds like it would be a lot easier than it is you can use store leads or you can use builtwith and you could Target people who have Shopify stores which that's going to get you a lot of the answers that you need but it's not going to get you perfect coverage for instance uh bar stool Sports is a media company that has a e-commerce platform right is it totally an e-commerce store I don't know because that's not what they functionally do as a business but that's how they get a lot of their revenue right so it's also a little bit of this depends on what you mean by e-commerce uh store and so I think if you pull the the builtwith list you'll also get Obama for America and Joe Biden and and all those other like they all have Shopify stores as well too so here we will pull the list from builtwith and then when we go into Apollo we will clean up the list and choose industries that we know are classically e-commerce Industries or if we if that cleans up our list too much we'll use clent to also go out and confirm hey is this actually an e-commerce company uh accounting firms using webflow that's probably even easier than what we were talking about before with webflow you're just going to download the report from builtwith of companies who are using webflow and then um download the list from builtwith with webflow oh and then use the accounting filter or accounting bookkeeping keywords in Apollo to do that as well to to just do your filtering even more and then SAS companies that have hired data scientists so this one is fun I think Clay is the only company that you can or only data set you can use to actually get this you're going to first have to start with a sass list so you're going to pull that from crunch base or ocean whatever it might be and then once you pull that SAS list what you want to do is you want to use clay to see if clay can find anyone who is at these companies that has the title around some kind of data scientist or data engineer or whatever it might be then it's not like you're going to go contact those people now you have your s say you have 50,000 SAS companies and 5,000 of them have hired data scientists now you're going to take that list of companies and then you're going to go put it into Apollo or you're going to put it into clay and find the people you actually want to contact like the CTO or the CEO or whatever it might be and that will be your your list so again it's start with a list of SAS companies use Clay's find people search to find the companies for free that have hired SAS people and set the limit so you only find one person per company because as soon as they have one you know that they're qualified and then you've got the list of 5,000 companies that have hired a data scientist take that list and then go find the CEOs of the companies and things like that right um restaurants I wouldn't even touch this uh with Apollo or anything else just go straight to D7 lead finder and to the Google Map scraper and use the local business workflow uh video that I have to to find the contacts now principles of tools is a really good one because sometimes they have LinkedIn profiles and sometimes they don't have LinkedIn profiles but they are always always always always listed on the website so I would use the Apollo data or the clay data to find as many schools that have a LinkedIn profile as I possibly could and then we would which a lot of them will because a lot of them do hiring off of LinkedIn so a lot of them will have um a LinkedIn page and then you could also combine this with the Google Map scraper because schools has a really good keyword tag or category tag in Google maps and then you scrape the the list of schools and then you can use cayen to find the people at the company that are listed as the principles then what's great about the people at the schools is oftentimes if they don't have the email address publicly listed it's they they will have somebody's email address publicly listed is it is never a secret what these people's email addresses are at all I would then just set up another CL agent to go find the principal's email address or if it can't find that figure out what the um figure out what the oh pattern of the email address is using cayan and then guess it and then use an email validator for that and so just another thing with list building that you just need to expect is that PE the schools they often times will have a school website and then the email address that they use is using a different domain than the school website you found them on because they might be pure pontu schools.com and then they're a part of the Rutherford school district so their email addresses are Rutherford school district.com not Pont school so that's just something to watch out with with that uh but then build a lookalike list for companies similar to instantly so I think I put this out here just because I wanted sometimes people bash tools that build lookalike list and most of the time I think it's a little unfair because when you enter a company for a look like a lot of times the platform doesn't know why you want this company in particular as a lookalike company and so um if you put in instantly. a it might look at that and say okay this is a sales SAS or it might even just say this is a SAS company or it might even it might get down deep enough and it say it's a sales engagement company right and so when you just put in instantly. a who knows what it's actually going to come up with for the look like so you got to use the keyword filters that come with these look likee tools to find the best companies that you could possibly do but so in summary I hope I hope this video makes sense and it's useful to people but basically in summary when you're building lists you need to make a determination of one is my audience on LinkedIn or are they going to be on Google Maps if they're on Google Maps we need to be using AI agents to find the contacts because there's not going to be a great way to find the contacts using LinkedIn data so that just goes off into its own world over there then you have to decide okay can I filter for these companies inside of these data sets Okay if yes then let me just use these data sets and pull them out I'll find contacts with Apollo and Clay we're all going to be set or do these data sets do they not have something custom built for me so for manufacturing companies that say based in the United States no database is going to have that off the shelf for you you're going to have to use something like clay with clent or serper to find those keywords on the website because Apollo is not going to have a made in the USA filter inside of them so that would be an example of something that is custom to you that you're not going to be able to filter for so the thought process here again is is it LinkedIn or Google Maps if it's Google Maps go with the local business workflow and use clay F contacts if it's not Google Maps do the platforms have the filters that you need in order to be successful if yes then keep going with the the platforms as far as you can if not build an AI agent that is finding what you need off of the website that they might not mention another great example of this is if you want to find companies that sell their software for $350 or more per month or they have Enterprise pricing you're going to have to use cagent for that or you're going to have to use serer that there's nothing there's no database that's going to be able to get that data for you so a lot of this comes down to those things and I hope some of those examples uh were helpful to talk through how we do it but um yeah most of the time we're using Apollo we're using one of these databases we're using DED lead finder or appify to live scrape some of this data sales navigator to live scrape some of this data and this is you know basically what we're using so I hope this was helpful and I hope it's a good addition for our 2024 wrapped document\#\# Date Posted: 2024-08-01

\# everyone in this video we're going to go over about 30 custom lines that we use on behalf of our customers when they don't actually have another better thing to say and so what I mean by that is I always tell my customers our goal is to send generally the same email you would send if you had 10 minutes to research a prospect and uh whatever custom message you would send we want to scale that to your entire market now sometimes people send very Advanced custom things you can check out my other YouTube videos for those things but um sometimes they're so specific that there's no point in making a YouTube video on it because it wouldn't be beneficial to anybody except for my customer but sometimes they don't have really great uh data that they could be researching for so we use a lot of these as fallbacks in place of that so we just have something else interesting to say in our email campaigns we use clay.com to build all of them and so we might take a field trip over to clay.com to show you very very quickly how we build some of them and uh let's jump into them so we're going to jump in and we're going to go through each of these I'll zoom in a little bit so that you could see and like I said these aren't for everybody but they're pretty General and I hope that you could take a little bit of an understanding of how we put some of these AI generated lines together and uh we will go to clay.com if you'd like to see just a quick excerpt of how we put some of these things together so company Mission summary this is one that we often will use uh especially when you're reaching out to companies that aren't in the same vertical so if you're reaching out to bowling alleys there's no point in using something like this but if you sell to a bunch of different people it doesn't really matter what they do as a company they just need to have a marketing department then this is something that could work for them and so we'll just say like I saw how you help people Mission what they do and wanted to reach out and so this is really really simple to set up in clay let me pull some things up so this is a general clay template that we just use on behalf of our c customers here and there well actually we use this all the time but so what we do is we take care of all the email validation and all that crazy stuff uh right inside of here and so if we wanted the company Mission there's uh basically an AI prompt that we have in order to do that and so if we just go to use Ai and then we go to browse prompts and we just say Mission we get the company mission for an email first line and so this is basically the prompt that we use in order order to get this done now you never want to just enter a website and just say hey you know ai go out and tell me what the mission is of this company you always want to give it a description we'll pull this from their LinkedIn company description or we'll use Zen Rose to Ping their website and get some text from maybe their SEO description or if we need even more we'll get it from the actual first page of their website and that's how we'll write this one in here so pretty pretty easy to do in clay you know I'm not sure if you'd have any more more questions on top of that this is our prompt and you know it's pretty pretty dang simple title plus time and roll notice you've been the title for about time years it figured you're the right person to reach out to this could change to months as well too all this is is we're just in clay and this doesn't even use AI to be completely honest we'll just jump into clay and we'll just use the enrich person from profile over here and then we'll just run this real quick and so in the experience section of enrich profile they're just going to tell you exactly how long they've been there and you could just use a formula to figure out how many months or years it's been and all those things I don't know why it's not running hold on let's look at this whoops switch it for this oh because it was pulling from there sorry so then if you just jump in here and you just see their experience you'll see all of this stuff in here and then you'll say start date they started as the chief Revenue officer in 2019 May 1st 20 well just may 2019 you don't actually know the date because it's LinkedIn data and so just a couple things here we'll actually uh use filter list of object to just confirm that the first experience that pulls up matches the LinkedIn company URL that we have in our data because sometimes people might say that they're an angel investor or or something like that and they might say you know I'm an angel investor and then I'm also the chief Revenue officer but it so it's not just the first experience that's there so make sure you use filter list of objects and then um once you've used filter list of objects then make sure that it's a current experience and that current experience matches the LinkedIn company URL that you think that they work at and then you can move on and you can write this out and it's super easy literally if you just uh bring the experience say latest experience I'm not going to go through filter list of objects right now but if you literally just go here and you make your start date and then you push forward and then you just say formula you could say uh how many years ago or how many months ago was this start date and then you could generate the formula or you might have to use AI for this but anyway oh no perfect so it has the the dates in here so this is was like two years ago perfect right then you could just use another formula to just say you know divide by whatever and so this would be like so you divide by 12 and so you're like all right you've been there for about five years and always put that about in there and then you know you've been here for about a year you've been here for about two years you know and you can just change everything as you go title plus company Mission plus job description from LinkedIn profile figured you're the right person to reach out to considering so what we we're doing here is we will make a gigantic prompt in clay where we basically say okay this is the person's title this is what they say they do at their company and this is the mission of the company just so that we can get a line that comes together to basically say you know you're the chief marketing officer you say that you're in charge of you know running all of the ads and making sure that the company has enough marketing qualified leads so I figured you were the right person to reach out to just something really really custom so then but then we want to put the company mission on top of it so I figured you were the right person to reach out to considering your CMO role and I figured you're in charge of marketing qualified leads so that you can help more Fitness enthusiasts breathe better or something like that so it's like a really personalized first line up top here the recommendation call out this we use most often as a PS line and so this is another super easy one to just share in this data in here you'll see that one of the data points is recommendations so not everyone has recommendations but but if they do have people who have left recommendations all we'll do is we will just use AI to just call out the person who left the recommendation and a quick summary of what they said just and I like using this as a PS line because if that wasn't left as a fake thing it it's you know you can't just use Apollo and just pull up a list from Apollo or Zoom info or seamless and write that line so it just pushes it over the edge a little bit of just some AI generation there link LinkedIn post call out this is probably one of my favorite ones um because not many people know that it can be automated so clay has a function literally for LinkedIn posts and I I'm not sure find recent posts by user or company so then you could pull this and again it's just an AI line uh to just summarize that you saw the the latest LinkedIn post another company called lead magic also has LinkedIn post data if you don't like the LinkedIn post data you're getting from clay you can use lead magic as well and you'd be all set there and so again it's just a quick prompt of you know hey write a summary of this LinkedIn post using my prefix and then your prefix is hey I saw your LinkedIn post about blah blah blah and then keep it under 10 words and whatever it might be and that's just another fun one that I really like to use this one is probably my favorite one overall that we use across as many customers as I possibly can again this won't work if you sell to bowling out because if you sell to bowling alleys and you have some software for bowling alleys you do the same thing for every bowling alley but if you use this basically you're inferring how your product or service can help them accomplish their mission so we will train AI on what our company does and we'll just say and and when I say train I mean we just add five sentences about what our company does and then we'll use their company description or their SEO description or the first couple of uh paragraphs from their website and we'll say okay how could we help this company and so then for us it would be you know specifically I think I could help you I think we could help you um you know automate some outbound pipelines so that you can have more conversations with Chief Financial officers whatever it might be right and so this one I think this applies for everyone in my opinion like everybody should be using this one um previous company call out I like using these in follow-up emails so saying figured you didn't leave IBM stoked to worry about and then the boring problem you solve so I figured you didn't leave IBM stoked to worry about email deliverability or I figured you didn't leave IBM Stoke to worry about you know cleaning lead lists or whatever it might be personally I just like using it in follow-ups because it just adds a nice touch because a lot of times our follow-ups when I say ours I mean like the community of cold emailers uh don't have any fun data in them so this just helps add some more uh company analogy I really like this one I uh basically we're just analogizing every company in the world B2B helps people save time save money or make more money so we'll just analogize and we'll say hey the same way you help people save time on email deliverability we help people save time on list cleaning or the same way you help people make more money uh with Amazon FBA we help people say make more money with outbound uh automations right whatever it might be there's um a ton of you know different things but but the only thing I would caution you when you're using these analogies is that so if you don't force it to link up save time save money make more money the problem you're going to run into is it's going to be like hey the same way that you help veterinarians we help people with their outbound pipelines and it's like no no like there's no analogy like being made there right and so you want to say the same way you help veterinarian safe time we help sales team safe time like you want you want that to be the analogy across it because that's the thing that every offer is going to break down into so when we train this we train and when I say train I just give data about this is how I help people save time this is how I help people save money here's how I help them make more money figure out what this company most likely does and then make an analogy between that so help them figure like do they help people save time save money make more money whatever it might be um review scrape from Google or Yelp or G2 Etc and then we can say saw the review about how you and then boom probably the easiest one to just talk about is like a Yelp review just you could literally just in clay just pull up Yelp and then it would come with the reviews in the output for the find reviews right or you can use clent to go find the reviews as well too and both of those work really well just make sure that you filter them for positive reviews because you don't want to reach out to somebody about negative reviews even if you only want to Target with people people with negative reviews it's still not going to be a good idea to reach out to people and comment on their negative reviews just don't do that uh we'll also use clent to find case studies mentioned on their website we won't always find out what they did but we're just trying to mention the case studies uh because again that's just a data point that no data provider has that's a very custom thing with the onset of tools like cayan or even just Ai and web scraping generally that it's possible to get these things at scale usually you'd have to manually find this and that's why I really like it Webb traffic so this one is important because a lot of my customers want to Target based off of web traffic but similar web and semrush web traffic is never reliable at all so this is all in my opinion the way that you frame it so we say I know similar web isn't perfect but they said you had blank numbers per month and literally the way we pull this is we will so every similar web URL ever all has the same setup over here so it's similar web.com back website Noble project and so all we'll do over here is we'll just create a formula well I guess first we'll clean it and so we'll say normalize a domain so now it's clean right and we can just run this real quick and then once that's clean what we can do now is we can just create the similar web links as a formula so then we would just say concatenate and then it would be like similar web.com website backslash and and then we'll just do normalize a URL right throw that in there and now we've got the perfect similar web thing here and then we'll use now we'll point zenr at this and we'll scrape it with Zen Rose um and then honestly we just use a formula to just pull it out because for some reason Zen row won't parse the data so you just have to use a formula to pull it out um and so anyway that's just another fun one average order value for e-commerce Brands I've made an entire YouTube video on this go check that out basically we scraped the Google shopping page for all of the products that's not a thing you want to use cagent for because cagent is going to find like one product and it's not going to be good we'll use we'll scrape Google shopping for all the products we can find and then we'll use AI to figure out what the average order value is and then we'll also use a to actually name the items so that it looks pretty cool um again I've made a whole YouTube video on this if you want to see that you could see that over there in this video I know I'm going quickly all I'm trying to do is just give ideas I'm not trying to make this a full tutorial so including screenshots of pages this is just something like just use screenshot api. net and you can just take screenshots of pages if you need to upgrade if you if you need to take screenshots of pages that are protected by anti- scraping stuff use zenr and their proxy Network to get past it and you could set all that up maybe I'll make a video on that one day um and so then find a page where they mention something and send the link this is just classic Google search operators so personally when we do this in clay I find the Google integration to just be too expensive so we use a platform called serper dodev and we do all of our Google search uh stuff over here and so the thing with Google searches is if you put like site actually right here facebook.com Ena paramis right I was looking for this before oh it's going to continue so there's Google search operators that you can use to and now I feel like I lost my loom anyway there's Google search operators that you can use where you can find keywords on people's site so the only thing with this is you want to make sure that it's a keyword that if they actually mention this keyword on the site then it and it's on that page then you want to send it to them right so if you are searching for something like data processing in dendam there's no other page other than their privacy policy that's going to include the keywords data processing addendum but if you're looking for just Enterprise then they could have blogs that say Enterprise it could say it on their pricing page it could say so there's a lot of things that kind of go into this one outside of just the normal uh just a keyword lookup so just be careful about that one um CRA they rank on Google organic this one is really interesting and so what we'll do here is we'll say I did a search for Relevant keywords and saw you were ranked 13th for whatever and then we'll make some kind of comment so what we'll do is we'll use AI we'll look at their company description and we'll use Ai and we'll talk about and we'll prompt it in a way of like what keywords would somebody be searching when they are ready to buy from a company for this service or for this product and all they need to do is just find a company that does it right so we're looking for very high intent very you know ready to buy keywords right so then we will have those keywords and we'll create a Google search string like if the keyword is you know CSV Imports or done for you CSV Imports and let's say these are two keywords we'll just make the search CS uh CSV Imports for un for you CV Imports and then we'll just search this no site no nothing and then what we're doing here is then we'll use filter list of objects inside of clay to find where the domain of our Target uh Prospect shows up in that search so we could say I did a search for CSV Imports and saw you are ranked you know 10th and then you can make a comment on it depending on what you're doing here it just depends on what you're going to say right so if you're an SEO agency you could say hey I saw you rank for these keywords but if they're ranking one two or three you want to say hey Kudos like something that you're doing is working well congratulations but if they're ranked four five six seven maybe you want to send them a message about how you can get them to break the top three and then if they're past 10 then you want to say you know nobody's GNA see you you need to really break onto the first page at least and so anyway it it just depends on what you're trying to do here you can also see if they're running Google ads so the way we do this is very similar to the way that we do the organic one all you have to do is in serper just switch the results to include ads and it's a very similar process use AI to figure out what kind of keywords they'll probably be running ads for and then do those searches but you only can do one search at a time because you really want to find you want as many ad opportunities as you can so it might be like five or six ads opportunities uh technology call out I use the build with Chrome extension on your site and notice you had a history of using Tech okay so this one's important just from the way we frame it so with the built with I mean this is super easy you set this up in clay it's literally an integration you can figure out what they're using and then you can even filter it and so you can filter it by the last detected date but the only problem with builtwith data not the only problem one of the biggest problems with built with data is they'll say it's installed but it's actually been uninstalled so we like to say you had a history of using Tech just because then it just lands a little bit better that if they were using it and built with is wrong that it's not active anymore they can still say oh okay this might be true um but if they are using it right now then you nailed it and you're also crushing it there uh the people also viewed section I have a whole video on this as well too I have this theory that this section in here which is on everyone's LinkedIn profile this people also viewed section I have a theory that these people are actually closer I I think that these people are actually close to the person that you're looking at so if you go to my page uh whoops right and so on my page people you may know or other similar profiles so all these people and I think I'm looking at my page it's a little bit different people you you may know right so all these people have some Clos like they they are in some proximity of the main person that you're looking at and I think LinkedIn does something with the you know who you interact with or something like that where it would say okay maybe you know these people as well I found that Hans might know DK and they might know pen Frank and they might know some mutual Connections in here but there's a very high chance that they actually know these people in the people you may know section or the other similar profiles so in here you'll get people also know inside of clay I like using this as a PS line honestly we don't use this a whole ton I just wanted to show you that this does exist and you will basically say hey the LinkedIn algo PS the LinkedIn algo push me to profile after I was researching you know people also viewed person and then again from this person so I wanted to reach out again like this one we don't really use that often I just wanted to show you that it's possible notice you recently took over as title this is super easy same thing we were doing from before with the looking up their experience just filter the list of objects so that you're actually making sure that they have a start date at the company that you wanted them to and they're not just an angel investor and adviser for a company um new promotion or new job notice you really slly took over as title um oh wait I just went over that one open job you're hiring for a title make sure when you do this you clean it with AI because it gets a little funky you know this is all very easy stuff uh I'm G to jump into this one because this one is basically a basic version of this one this is one of my favorites where we'll say hey notice you're hiring for a title and it looked like this person would be responsible for responsibility considering the job description said and then we'll quote the job description and so what we're basically doing here is basically trying to reduce the job description to a two to three-word responsibility and then we're quoting the job description uh but we want to make sure that whatever the responsibility is is not the direct quote from the job description so I want this to end up saying notice you're hiring for an executive assistant and it looked like this person would be responsible for scheduling meetings considering the job description said quotes and we'll actually put quotes in uh work with external teams to manage the calendar of the founder or whatever it might be right and so you want to prompt AI to be thinking about that because it doesn't look great if it says this person would be responsible for managing the founders calendar considering the job description said manage the founders calendar right so you just want to make sure that the responsibility ends up being something different and we would definitely use two different AI prompts here to get it and we'll say okay this is the responsibility that we found from the job description do not say this responsibility again in the output but find a quote where it says to to provide support for this responsibility right and so that's a little bit of what we'll do summarize the company LinkedIn post is the same as a user LinkedIn post as well company news is pretty similar as well local restaurant call out honestly this one's just for fun don't reach out to funded companies with this don't reach out to e-commerce brands with this don't reach out to VCS with this don't reach out to anybody who receives a ton of potentially good emails the people who respond really well to these are local business owners who they don't get a high volume of emails just in general and so and honestly they they don't really get good email Outreach either so then when you reach out to them with this they think you actually sent them an email and so the way I used to do this is I used to scrape Yelp for this information and so we would say notice on LinkedIn you're based in New York City and we would just use um we would just use the LinkedIn data for this and then we would say if we could connect I'd be happy to buy you lunch at local popular restaurant so we used to scrape Yelp for this and then as they kept updating AI we just found that AI knew what the local popular restaurant was and it was much more accurate at not saying franchises because one problem we would have from Yelp is in some cities the greatest restaurant in the area is Chick-fil-A so then we would say if we connect I'd be happy to buy you L at Chick-fil-A and it doesn't it doesn't really show anything in there and so um AI is actually really good at finding the oldest best restaurant in the area and so that's just one that I I really like Google ratings call call out notice on Google Maps the 4.8 star reviews you all have so again that's super easy just inside of clay we could just go to Google and you can just find find business reviews information and it's right in there as well you could use Cent if you wanted to find this stuff uh traffic no data for seo.com is another place you could get this stuff it's super easy to get the Google ratings of these these companies noticed on Yelp the review person name left about AI summary of review again we just use clay for that we'll call out the person AI summary just make sure you filter for positive reviews uh I was about to call a phone number but figured email would be easier nothing groundbreaking here I just like sending this to local business owners so that you know they see their phone number in the the first line of the preview text and potentially it looks like we're maybe a customer don't put people's mobile phone numbers here always use the business phone number and this again works better when it's local business owners um because don't just don't put their mobile phone number here they think it's super creepy uh just use the publicly listed phone number from their Google my business page new leadership hire I noticed on LinkedIn that new leader hired recently joined the team and I sure they have a lot of new goals for the team so again we'll use clay for this and so we'll look and we'll say like find contacts at company and then say we're looking for people say we're looking for people who in in here we have directors of marketing and heads of marketing so then we'll look for chief marketing and we'll look for CMO and then we'll look for maximum number of months since start date and we'll put six and then we'll run this and I'm sure we won't get a ton of results here but this is exactly how we would run it we would just do this in line in clay and we didn't get anything which is totally fine just so that we can find you know somebody and say okay and this just becomes a different trigger for us right so if this is true we just change the messaging and we say okay like there's a new leader you know and then we're reaching out to the director of marketing and we just talk about how there's a new Chief marketing officer uh don't mind my loom video if it's crazy right now and so that's literally how we do this in here you just want to make sure you set up your table where it is for sure the director of marketing and then you're looking for the chief marketing officer and then you just want to make sure that the names aren't the same so also use a formula in clay to then say you know are these two names the same and so the name that you find over here versus the name over here because you don't want to say you know hey uh Lauren I was doing some research and I saw Lauren the new Chief Revenue officer that would be bad and and so just make sure that you don't you don't uh do that when you're doing that kind of Outreach competitor call out so we will actually this one's fun so again we're using serper for this one and so my actual search for this is something like outreach.io competitors United States right so we have the domain that we want to look up and then we're saying competitors and then we say United States so most companies will then you could skip the sponsored stuff because your server is going to skip the that stuff and so then you would get your Gartner results you get the G2 results you might get the Reddit results and you'll get all these things right in and so when you get these results you're going to get this snippet here and so this is funny sales robot is the number one Runner um and so you're G to get this snippet in here right and so what you can do is you can use Ai and you could say hey review all of these Snippets and tell me which company uh which company is named as a competitor most often so then sales Loft hopefully will come up the most often so see how sales Loft came up here sales Loft came up here and then it didn't come up here it didn't come up here but sales robot oh and then sales Loft came up here actually again so now ai is gonna infer oh you know sales Loft was named as the competitor most often we're gonna say sales Loft I like doing it this way instead of just trusting one data provider because especially with competitors people get really antsy about that stuff so we'll just pull all of these using a Google search in inside of the platform and then maybe I can just show you really quick how it would happen but um I'm not going to use serper because you guys would then be able to see my API key but so if we just put in the domain and then we say competitors and then you're just going to put in the country that the company is based in just so that it's you know if if there's something similar then at least we can try to figure it out well so then we've got all of these results we see this search result what's this answer box thing okay so this answer boox thing is pretty cool so you could also use this snippet and then you would also use the Snippets in here too and so that I wonder if this is new I haven't seen answer box before I am very interested oh this is just coming from G2 I was gonna say it would be so cool if that was the AI result but um then you would just have these Snippets right and so then you could just send these Snippets to one uh filter find keywords and more using formula and then you just send it to one column and then you just use Ai and you basically say okay hey you know outreach.io is the company we're looking up so do not output outreach.io because there's no way that could be the answer look at this snippet and tell me which competitor is mentioned most often and then it will tell you and so anyway that's how we do that one college popular event this one's just for fun honestly we've used it like once and I just wanted to include it I think it's personally kind of fun notice you went to college do you ever go have time to go back for a popular event unique to the school honestly if you just ask Ai and you just say what is a popular event that is unique to the school that occurred 20 years ago that also occurs today you'll get something pretty interesting so I went to ruter and so uh something that they do all the time is they there's a high dive board at Ruckers and so once a year they'll allow students to just jump off the high high dive board so that'd be something that would potentially be called out here right there's probably other football rituals or some other things that I can't think of and you know whatever uh call out if someone has never held a role before this is one of my favorites you want to be careful of which roles you're reaching out for but basically um the the best ones are the ones so for if especially the leadership ones right so if somebody's never been a chief marketing officer or they've never been a VP of sales or they've never been a Founder before uh those are the ones that are pretty easy to find and so we'll just look at the experience and we'll filter all of it and we'll come up with every version of Chief marketing officer that we can think of and then we could say oh you know it looks like you also want to be a little bit you know uh you want to protect yourself with the language a little bit so you want to say from what I could tell on your LinkedIn profile it potentially seems like this is the first time you've been a Founder before or whatever it might be or this is the first time you've explicitly said that you you're the founder of a company just something like that just to protect it I found that I I really like this kind of Outreach and then there's Dynamic image or meme sending we'll use uh dapic to dynamically change the images in here and then uh IP so another one that I like like to use too is we'll use AI to figure out who the ideal customer is of the people we're reaching out to and so you can use Ai and review the description and say okay who do these people most likely sell to but then you just want to train it on a bunch of things so you just want to train it on okay it you know if give it two company descriptions as an example of a b2c company and then give it two company descriptions of a B2B company right because then it's ICP for a B2B company would be Chief technology officers but for a b2c company it might be Fitness enthusiasts or Road biking cyclists or whatever might be because if you don't train it on B2B context and b2c context it's gonna like you know for a road cyclist it's going to come up with like director of Road biking or something and it you just don't want it to do that so that's another one of my favorite ones um another one that we have is uh if you I wonder if I still win this I used to win this oh sponsored sponsored oh I do still win this okay so if you look up gp4 prompt for cold email this one is one of my favorites uh to be quite honest and now this is a YouTube video of my YouTube videos which is pretty meta but um I love this one because this one just uses AI to come up with three ideas and let's go into this this one uses AI to come up with three ideas of how you could help a company these in particular are about 10 to 15 words but you could also make them much shorter you could make them longer whatever it might be again this is just an extension of the one we have up here right here specifically I think it could help you and then we just insert how we think we could actually specifically help them if we just give them more creative ideas this is just how we can help them more and so like I said we've actually created much much much more complicated things than this but if I were to tell you about those it be useful to two or three people because uh it it doesn't really matter and so use these for inspiration use them if you have to use them but the best AI uh generated text that you could possibly use is always the the text that you would send if you were to manually research a prospect so I was speaking in a friendly conversation nothing crazy with some people from brex the other day and they were saying okay what are top companies doing and I said don't worry about top what top companies are doing think about what you wish your SRS would be doing and so then they said oh yeah you know like what ideas would that be and I said well you know brex does really well with International payments right so you could use clay to figure out different countries that people have uh employees in and then use AI to figure out what the currency is of those countries and then you could say hey I noticed on LinkedIn you have a per you have uh a person in India and then you can name them you have a person in Brazil and you can name them and you have a person in France and then you can name them I'm just not going to say names because I don't want to get canceled for an assumption of names and so then you can name the names and then use AI to switch it to the euro to um to rupes and you know all of the the different currencies so you could say hey I was doing some research on LinkedIn so you have people all over it must be t uh time consuming to manage you know euros and rupes and uh whatever currency they have in Brazil and things like that and so we as an agency we build those messages for our customer I'm just not going over it here because now unless you run a competitor to brex that's not helpful to you at all but I just want you to think bigger about what you could possibly say with clay and a AI because clay brings all the data providers together AI can just make inferences and and things to change the messaging and things like that so don't settle for just generic Outreach anymore we've seen this increase positive response rates by three sometimes 5 x we're working with a public company right now that I am hoping we can talk about publicly but we have a a public company where we have doubled the positive response rate against the SDR team that's manually sending emails with Clay tables and AI generations and and all these other things so take a look yourself drop a comment if you liked it and uh I'll see you in the next

\# Inside Our Process of Developing Complex AI prompts for Cold Email

all right hey everyone uh we are about to do a pretty intense clay table build that I wanted to show everybody exactly how we're doing this one because it uh it has a lot of artificial intelligence steps and yeah it's pretty crazy so I figured I'd take a minute film this for you and uh we can jump right into it so the normal clay table that we have is a a template that we use all of the time where this every thing to the left of this column is just Apollo data we build our first initial list in Apollo and then we bring it through to Clay so you might have seen this before but we're essentially cleaning the email addresses from Apollo to see if they are valid running them through dagma to see if we can find an email address that maybe Apollo didn't have and then here we're cleaning the company name so we don't say something stupid in our Outreach like um trying to see like any of these would be stupid yeah like maybe like this is something that we kind of have to clean up a little bit better five stars stars by some up that would be nice if we could clean that up um everything else here looks good but anyway so everything up until here is kind of our normal table and then we're going to be AI generating all of our lines over here and we got started a little bit but uh I think I'm just going to refilm from here so the first thing we need to do is we need to just say I was on your site and saw he you help and then company AI admission statement this is super easy to do it's a preset inside of clay for us to be able to do this email first line the only thing is I did make this mistake yeah uh in the preset it used to have quotes and that's why Quotes come up here um that shouldn't be there so we're just going to rerun this to get that going and then uh now what we need to do on this one is see how we see we're saying I dug deeper and AI usage so so what's going to happen is we need to basically figure out is the company using AI like features and we need to figure out what kind of AI features are they using or are they not using AI features so the way we're actually going to do this is we need to create a Google search first to be able to do this so we're going to jump in here and we're going to create a Google search uh and actually you know what I don't think that the website is clean so we actually have to normalize the URL of the domain and the reason why we do this is because if you see how this these say HTTP face like fb.com HTTP nv.com when you put this into a Google search it's going to mess up your Google search a little bit so we're going to redo this so we'll do bear and then we're going to run this and then we're going to take the normalized URL and we're going to run that so remember how before they had HTTP in front of them now see how they're super clean and we could just put you know site domino.com so now we're going to open up our enrichments and we're going to use a Google search to find this so when we're using Google searches we need to use search operators so that when we do our Google search we're like a laser getting exactly the information that we need and we don't have like any time to mess around with other things so what we're going to do here is we are going to uh do a site search and so when we put site in the Google search query this means that we want Google to return results only from one particular website and that website is the one from our table so we'll put in the num normalize URL right there and now we need to look for a page where they mention AI features and so uh what we need to do is find that page where they mention AI so people are either going to talk about gpt3 they're going to talk about GPT 4 they're going to talk about chat GPT they're going to say AI they're going to say artificial intelligence there's lots of different things that they're going to say in order to call out the fact that they are um um using an artificial intelligent feature so when we create this Google Search we need to use a parentheses because I don't care if they mention AI I don't care if they mention um gp4 I don't care if they mention chat GPT I just need one of those to come up and then that's going to be what we need so we'll say site normalized URL and then we'll type out everything so I'm going to say artificial intelligence and see how we put that in quotes when it's in quotes and we do the Google search it has to return artificial intelligence as that keyword if you don't put quotes it could technically return artificial by itself or intelligence by itself so that's why we put quotes around it and then we're going to put a capitalized o r because we're looking for multiple things and it doesn't matter which one pops up so we're going to say o r i want to put AI but if somebody puts the word gain on their website that is going to pop up and so we're going to stay away from just putting out AI because it's just going to mess us up so we're going to put gpt3 or GPT or for some reason GPT 4 doesn't get caught by GPT or AI gp4 oh or chat GPT or chat GPT see I'm just putting spaces in between uh in case and then we're just going to put parentheses around that and now we only need one result so we're just going to keep our table clean it costs nothing extra to get like three results actually but we're just going to keep our table clean like I said so now we're going to run this on the first 10 to see what we get and so now we're just going to check this out a little bit so we have data climber five ways modern marketing analytics can help your business what does this company do this is a consulting company so what we're going to do to clean up this search is see how this is a Blog I don't actually want the blog I want features so we're going to jump in here and in order to exclude blog we're going to put the minus sign and then we're going to put blog so now we're telling hey we want all of these searches but I don't want blog to be a part of the the search so here we go come on data climber way way better okay so fb.com I'm pretty sure this is like Facebook yeah okay so Facebook is using artificial intelligence that makes sense transparency that's where meta artificial intelligence comes in okay so they're definitely using AI let's check this one 100 plus top AI companies now what does this company do this is like a learning okay we are probably going to go back to our Apollo search and just take the people out because this is just a bad fit um and we were just doing a pretty broad Apollo search so we will just take them out anyway AG of GPT is train on your organization's data perfect this is like what we this is what we're looking for here so this is a really good result that we wanted and so we're going to extrapolate this and I'm just going to try this on a couple more just so we get more results and a lot of this and the reason why I'm not cutting this video right now is because people ask all the time to see exactly how we do this and so this is exactly how we do this this is going to be a full long form video of precisely how we get these things done so it's going to be crazy to me if crunch base doesn't get a detection the rest of these made sense yeah so interesting all right everyone I know it's very ironic I just said that I'm not going to pause the video but I did just do some checking around and pause the video so I apologize about that but what I was looking for was this uh this Google Search was actually not working in the way that I wanted it to and so clay has this new feature in beta right now called clent and so I jumped into using that and it worked way way way better than um the Google uh search so basically I just use Cent and I said does this company listed here have features powered by AI on the website don't look at programmatic SEO Pages look at just the main homepage to see if they talk about AI features this is the company to look at and then normalized URL and then I was only using 3.5 the reason being is because if we get this wrong I'm gonna like hedge and in the email copy I'm just going to say I took a quick look at your website um if we get it wrong honestly it's the end of the world and so uh I put the Max cost at 0.01 because I didn't want this to completely like blow up what we're doing here from a cost perspective but if we look at these companies it is way better \[Music\] um great so like domino.com yes the company gridex has featured Powers by features powered by AI on their website um they include platform modeling influencing advising enhancing design experience the analys the information was found on the company's homepage and various linked Pages awesome yes liveo bank they leverage AI in their portfolio companies excellent so that's going to get weeded out that's a uh Venture Capital firm we we're not going to run that features they're talking about AI in uh mamography I'm so sorry if I pronounced that incorrectly Conquer Cancer through AI yeah they definitely use AI in their their uh workflows just checking one more sorry if this is boring yes the company na has feutures powered by AI based on the search results multiple articles and blogs security features using machine learning with AI free custom okay so now we need to build a gigantic prompt and so we're saying I dug deeper and AI usage so usually I would use a clay formula to basically be like if the Google search existed we're going to write a line about how they used AI features if it doesn't exist then we're just going to write this line we are going to attempt and I say attempt we are going to attempt to get this done in just one AI prompt and what I mean by this is I basically want AI to think about this in a step by step pattern where it's going to say first I'm GNA say make a determination if this company is using AI as a feature in their company if it is not just say this don't output anything else just just say this if it is then this is what I want you to say so we're going to put this prompt Together live hopefully not take up too much time using the inputs so sorry already got distracted using the inputs accomplish these tasks in Step order first these are the inputs input one I found that if you label what the input is it really helps input one is the answer the company does or does not use AI on their website and then we're going to map this in here and so we're going to take result input two is the evidence that we found that they use AI on their website and what they do with it boom reasoning and we also get a confidence score from clent and what I'm going to do I could put the confidence score in here but I'm not going to do that I'm going to make it run only if the confidence score is is above a level and I'm going to make that a conditional formula so I'm not even going to worry about that right now input two is this blah blah blah the first decision that you need to make is whether or not the company is using AI in their Outreach if no no no no AI well I'm thinking about us AI on their platform or in their processes if they are not using AI if they are not using AI your only output should be and then we're going to take the sentence should be this and then we're going to put it and then I'm going to put quotes and then I'm going to separate it so it doesn't take the quotes with us we're going to say this I don't think I saw uh we're going to say this I don't think I saw any public facing features leveraging AI on the site just yet I did just have a quick look again we just want to hedge a little bit and just like if we're wrong if they are using AI then create a sentence about how they are using Ai and use keywords from the inputs keep the sentence under 15 words and you uh no yeah keep the sentence under 15 words complete each sentence in this sequence in this complete each sentence about AI features with my prefix this is my prefix we always want to use a prefix so that we are the ones who are in control of what AI is saying I don't want it to say anything crazy I dug deeper and saw you're using ai2 and then we're just going to put that in there now this is a massive prompt there's a lot of ways that this can go wrong but I've tried to mitigate all the ways that this can go wrong the way that we are going to push this forward to not going wrong is one final part of the prompt think step by step about the solution your uh whoops your output should never be anything like no they aren't using AI or basic references uh if they are using AI you should only output sent es in the way I stated this part's just funny I don't know if this is going to affect anything maybe we should AB test if this affects anything I am trusting you to do this carefully good luck I think that's just funny I don't think it's going to do anything but we'll see now the way that we like really bring this all the way home is and I'm just going to save this real quick I thought it closed the window without saving my heart dropped a little bit um um we're going to open this up and oh yeah so what I want to do is I'm just going to map these uh results and reasons to the table so that I can use them because now what we're going to do is we're just going to train it on what to do so now like a lot of people ask they're like well how do you use this in your Outreach uh if you aren't checking each one by one and it's because we just train the model like it's way more worth your time to just pay open AI to like train the model here than it is to just like go through and check everything one by one so we're going to put this here now um clay just has a odd feature thing that I just have to move these over for okay great now let's open this up all right so now we're going to train the model so we are first going to train the model on uh what to do when it's a good answer so we're going to copy and paste this entire thing we're going to put this in here and now we're not going to put the result and we're not going to put the reasoning as tokens we're actually going to copy and paste them so this we are going to copy and paste in here Oopsy Daisy yep and then here we're going to take input two based on the search result blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and now we are going to manually write this email so they are using it so we're going to use our prefix down here I dug deeper and saw you're using AI to blah blah blah blah blah okay what are they using AI for based on the search results multiple articles for uh AI tools for small business security features using machine learning conference calls with AI background okay I dug deeper and saw you're using AI to help keep small businesses secure boom we're just going to keep it at that keep it super simple that's exactly what I wanted to say now we need to train it on another one another one that we need to train it on is when there is no information about AI features on Dee's website great that's what we're going to do so come back to this copy and paste this big one put it into here and now we're going to train it and so we're going to put oh whoops we're going to put this no there is no information about AI features blah blah blah blah blah reasoning and now we're going to map the reasoning oh we don't have the reasoning where's Delight okay here now we're going to train it that when there's no reasoning we want it to say something very specific if they're not using AI we want it to say this I don't think I saw public features boom I don't think I saw any public features excellent so now we're going to adjust to settings we're just going to like run uh one we want to make sure this is GPT 4 we want to use the smart people on this one this is a tough one and then we just want to conditionally run this like only run if Master email column is not empty the reason why we're doing this um is like if we can't even email them why would we uh waste this and we want to do result is not empty and yeah that's all we're going to do so here we go output is correct um we can try on five which is going to be free so let's do that and I'm just going to pause the video because this is starting to turn into a really long video so results are coming back and they're looking pretty good so we have over here I well I mean we uh we trained this one so that one's pretty good cargo so we'll look at cargo the search results they're using predictive audiences I dug deeper and sorry using AI to drive predictive audience platform I don't think I saw any public facing features that's true um company grid x what do they do these modeling influencing blah blah blah blah blah I dug deeper and sorry using AI to enhance design analysis and balance processes excellent all right so we nailed it here so we're just GNA have so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to map this inside of clay and I'm going to call this AI usage is like what we're really going to call this no we're going to No we're going to keep this as AI usage response and so then what we're going to do is we're going to write just a quick formula because we always want catchalls if it's if it it's not the correct data we want to be able to fall back on something so we're going to say if response is empty output and then we're going to put the line here because what we're going to do is we're just going to default we're just not going to make up the fact that they have ai features we're we're just going to say like hey I don't think I saw anything generate formula and so this is free so I don't need to set up anything of like oh you know like if they have it here they don't have it here so now we're going to call this no now we're going to merge these and so it'll be like the first line we want to pull in is this AI usage line and then if AI usage is empty we want to pull in our new formula and now we're going to call this AI usage for campaign and I'm going to put it in all caps because we like this is going live in the campaign of what we're actually going to put in great not sure why this one is empty but we will troubleshoot that later we have more to do uh okay next what we're going to do I had some ideas on how you could go deeper into AI how you could start using AI in your platform okay great so this is just a conditional statement \[Music\] so basically we could just create a formula of just like see how it says I don't think I saw any publication or I dug deeper basically we're going to say if AI usage contains I don't think uh output and then we're just going to take the line I had some ideas on how you could go oh yeah yeah yeah and then we're going to Output this line so I had some ideas on how you could go deeper into Ai and we'll put that there and we'll delete this okay great so we're going to generate this formula and we want to make sure row number one says I had some ideas on how you could start using AI in your platform row number two says I had some ideas on how you could go deeper which that means we did everything correctly I had some ideas on how you could start using AI I don't think I saw any public facing features I had some ideas how you could go deeper into AI I dug deeper and saw your I don't want to say deeper twice actually uh I had some ideas on how you could enhance the user experience with AI more are you working on these currently let's also hedge to make sure so we'll hit generate formula and now this is going to be good to go cool so now we're going to call this what do we want to call this email one line three sometimes it's as creative as that email one line three all right now we're going to move on to oh now we need to create creative ideas so and sorry like see how we say creative ideas generated by AI but how they could use AI more pretty meta I love it that's like I love my job okay here we go so we're going to come in here and then we're just going to put creative because there's a template for this output Creative Marketing ideas in a bulleted format we're not actually going to use the So Okay the reason why we're not going to use the template is because there's going to be so much editing to do on that template that I just don't even want to mess with with the template so we're not going to use that one and then uh creative ideas AI so the other thing that I don't think we've done is we need the description of the company okay we have the description of the company never mind moving on so we're gonna this is a pretty classic prompt that I love to use all the time using the input create a three bullet list of creative ideas that a company could use ai4 in their platform the inp puts I will give you is the description of the company and if we have it some information about what they are currently using AI for if they uh if we don't have information about what they are currently using ai4 ignore that and work with what you have this is the input of the company description this is the input of how the company may be using AI today and we're going to use reasoning here keep each bullet point under 15 words and think creatively about how new AI features would create a better experience for customers um I had a thought if we know how they are using AI today consider if we know how they're using AI today consider that and don't mention the same features go beyond those features okay here we go so the way that they use AI right now is they include platform modeling exploration CSR calculate the information found on the company's home and varied okay great gex partners with utilities an energy suppliers to transform their business businesses and accelerate the clean energy transition era Enterprise rate platform helps these organization develop new products and business models to achieve their clean energy goals anybody else who's watching this video are you lost on what this company does I kind of get it but I'm a little lost grid xplatform is used by Leading utilities Retail Energy suppliers and energy ecosystems oems to serve more than 19 million homes excellent work with new businesses to use Ai and understand their current operational inefficiencies that AI can solve well inefficiencies look there's this bug and Clay it might still be there see I'm going to do this word like correct right I corrected it then I hit space oh sometimes it went back they fixed it awesome good for them um sometimes it doesn't allow me to like add a paragraph space for some reason so I got to just like put that in yeah okay so now I want to say something about energy in this one partners with utility um analyze large sets of data sets with energy companies to understand and predict Peaks much more uh peaks in demand more more efficiently and then last one what are we going to do here I want to say something about their Enterprise rate platform so I just train the AI that like hey we got to use keywords goals onboard new customers to your Enterprise R platform to help them understand their operational the opportunities in their business faster okay great and so now we're just going to set this setting so so that it's like we can put Auto on this one it'll be fine um but here we want to make sure that the company job description the I mean the company description is longer than 40 characters so only run if Master email column is not empty and description is over 40 characters now in so back when we were looking at the description some of them said run condition not met and so the reason why the Run condition isn't met see actually it's right here is because there's no master email over here so technically we don't even really need this because there wouldn't be a description anyway but I just put it in there for redundancy is not empty and description is over 40 characters we do this because if they just put a description of like a word it's absolutely useless it it doesn't help us at all um and then AI is g to be like oh this input isn't good enough for you and like I can't figure this out it's like yeah I know sorry so now we'll run that and then we'll just check on the responses here and we're going to start getting ready for the next one great okay uh oh wait that's totally different okay so this is email 2 competitor is a different campaign guessing your team is working on business problem being addressed by AI if you could oh so this is actually our client needs to give us more information about these guessing your team is working \[Music\] on so I'm going to change this line because looking back on it sometimes I write copy and then I like lines better um um okay so this is what we're going to do here I imagine the marketing team is really busy connecting with customer type to help them how they help would it be useful if the technical team could ship AI features faster so this is what we're going to go with here um now we're just going to check these I know I'm kind of switching back and forth so on first glance these look really good we're going to come back and we're going to achieve email 2 right now so we need to create this line and we're going to create this line just based off of the company description so this is what we're going to do we're going to hit this we'll hit this hit this and now we're going to say using the input output put a sentence about the kinds of customers a company sells to and how they help them this is the input and we'll put the description again the output under 15 words and think critically about the kinds of customer this company sells to and so um complete each so here we can't use a prefix because if we only talk about the prefix we're not going to get the rest of the um we're not going to get the rest of it right so I'm going to give it a framework to complete so complete each output with my framework sentence this is is my sentence and then we're going to put this in here I imagine blah blah blah blah blah imagine the marketing team I don't need you to generate the text that isn't in between the no that yeah isn't in between generate two to three words about the kinds of customers they sell to for customer type oh we should put this in Brackets generate 6 to8 words oh not 608 6 to8 words about how they help and replace how they help great and again we're just going to train this so it gets it super super right for us so we'll hit this hit this description we're going to move over and we're going to do a description memorable experien for advertisers that do all this stuff great we're going to pick that one here we go so who does cargo sell to remember that go beyond the first impression to Captivate with a suite of exclusive onni Channel Advertising Solutions all right so they sell to like paid media marketers Chief marketing officers and digital marketers so we're going to say I imagine the marketing team is really busy connecting with because for this campaign we're targeting like the CTO of the company company's really busy connecting with digital marketers to help them and then okay so we're going to focus on the top here uh to help them okay cool again we just need the description to be over 40 words or characters just so that it doesn't write anything crazy and now we're going to run this now this is going to achieve email 2 this actually we need to get from the customer now this one one I think I'm going to pause the video and we're going to do this in another video because now I meant to post this on YouTube but it's starting to get extremely long and I'm not sure if people are going to watch this um if you did watch the entire thing that's crazy appreciate you uh if you didn't I kind of understand why um so thanks everyone for watching and I hope this was useful\#\# Date Posted:

\# 25 Cold Email Tips in 21 Minutes @ Clay HQ

last year in 2024 we send between 1.5 million and 2 million cold emails on behalf of our 40 to 50 customers at any given time we're going to go over 25 lessons that we learned in the past year and hopefully we can make them super fast so they can be actionable for all of you let's go keep your inbox volume low on each inbox and per domain right now we're sending about 30 emails per inbox for those of you who are unfamiliar with the email infrastructure of cold email you can't actually use a platform like HubSpot and send out a bunch of hold emails they're going to ban you so what we do is we use multiple domains Google Outlook inboxes whatever might be and we keep the volume low on each domain so as far as Google's concerned we've only sent 30 emails but we scale horizontally you can use instantly. to do this smartly DOI they both have done for you email setups this is just the common practice that we're using right now to stay underneath the spam filters for our inbox setups Target 40 to 60% open rates on your cold email campaigns now for those of you who might not know ever since the Apple iOS update any person who has their email account tied to the mail app on their Apple iPhone the open flag triggers automatically so can we actually trust open rates if you're tracking them no but they can be a good signal if you're Landing in the inbox or not because emails in the spam folder will not trigger the open tracker and so if you are tracking open rates we don't and we can talk about that in another section you want to track between 40 and 60% anything really below 30% you're having an email deliverability issue if you're not using custom domain tracking you really need to turn that on for your domains and if you are already using that I would set up more domains and inboxes so that you can start start fresh warm them up for 3 weeks and get your campaign started again when it comes to troubleshooting domains for deliverability don't spend a lot of time seed testing and doing deliverability testing just look at your overall reply rate or the open rate if you're tracking it and if it's below 1% of an overall reply rate not counting out of office emails don't waste your time doing spam tests or Glock apps tests or any of those other things the end result is always going to be you're going to have to set up new domains rewrite your copyrighting and then start the new campaign all over again so that you cannot get marked to spam stop sending email campaign CS with more than three emails in a sequence with all of our data across all of our customers best performing campaign of our email campaigns was always email number one then we got diminishing returns from email number two and email number three the only time I've ever seen a caveat to this shout out to Patrick from uptic is when he intentionally was doing something funny between email 1 and email 2 across all of our campaigns email 1 is the most important if you keep sending email four 5 6 7 8 you're most likely just going to be annoying the person and you're going to get marked as spam send three emails and when you go through that list just reuse the list you were about to email them nine times anyway it's just all the same thing you can refresh your data in clay get better things to say and take new learnings into the new campaigns keep those campaigns at three emails Max you should be reusing your Tam list every quarter if not even longer let's say you have an email campaign and you have 50,000 people in your target addressable Market we're sending a three email sequence to all of them when you first started that sequence what are the odds that when you first emailed this person 2 weeks later that enough has changed in their business that they're actually going to be feeling different about your offer by putting time in between when you first sequence somebody and then when you sequence them again more time has changed in their business where now priorities have changed the environment has changed something about their business has changed that now they might be more interested in your offer this is always pivotable when we do math and you don't have an infinite Target addressable Market people come back to us and they say how many emails should we be sending per day first try to get that ratio of the amount of leads that you get and as many positive responses as you get as low as possible then once you've done 10 tests or so and you've gotten it as low as you possibly can do your math and figure out how many emails do I have to send so that I would have to reuse my list every 3 months giving enough time in the person's business to be able to change or in their role so that when you sequence them you're actually sequencing a person with different priorities trust me they're not going to remember your cold email none of you remember a cold email you received 20 minutes ago it's going to be fine you just need the timing of the business to change don't send an email until you get these things right first in 2024 2025 tools like clay give us an infinite amount of filters that we can create criteria for list building what I see too much of is a spray and prey tactic where you say okay I sell to the banking industry and it's anybody with 20 to 500 employees and then I sell to anybody with a director marketing title and above the problem with this is the person who is the director of marketing at a 20 person bank is a completely different person than a director of marketing at a 500 person bank and so what you want to do is use your targeting and look at your current customers and the people you currently work with and think about what are the things that they find interesting about your product or service and where are those break points they'll happen at different places but often times it's not going to fit into a direct 1 to 10 employees 25 to 50 employees whatever that might be take a look at where you think those break points are and do your best to use filters like the employee headcount filter the geography filter the title filter in clay you can even dig into what people actually say is their focus in their job because of their job experience use that data in your Outreach as well and mine it for keywords be much more succinct and careful with what you're doing with your filtering so that you can actually make your messaging reson and you don't even have to use AI but we'll get to AI later leverage clay to build a golden ICP by waterfalling data points and triggers first off a golden ICP let's take an accounting company for example accounting companies can service anybody but wouldn't it make sense that it would be better for them to reach out to a new company because a new company might not already have an accountant or they're growing into the size that they're going to need a dedicated accountant so that's better then we take it a step further and we say okay we want new companies that raised money because the investors are going to need the books to be extremely clean and they're going to need you to have some kind of real bookkeeping and process in there okay then if we add another one on top of this and we say the company is new they've raised money and the CEO has never been a CEO before we have a very different message that we could send across all of these things Clay is the only tool in the marketplace that allows you to run all of these enrichments and change your messaging when all three of them are true when two of them are true when only one of them is true or when none of them are true and you still want to be reaching out to those people when we waterfall this what we could do is we could set up your highest priority signal first the biggest thing is we want to know that the company is new the fact that they're funded and the fact that CEO's never been a CEO before is just gravy on top I'm not going to reach out to anybody unless the company was found in the last 2 years so when we're setting up our clay table we'll run that first so we don't waste Integrations on everything else then we can run Integrations and waterfall and only if they are recently founded we can check if they're recently funded and then we can run that integration in this case I think it doesn't really matter that they raised money to see if the CEO has never been a CEO before so I would run that without an exclusion but you could only run an enrichment to see if they've never been a CEO before but in this way all along this tier you could change your messaging hey congrats I noticed you recently found the company how's it been going this is terrible copy but you know do you need accounting services and then you change it oh you're funded you must have investors now that the company's getting off the ground they want to see better accounting analytics two wow congrats I see in your lengthen experience you've never publicly said you've been a CEO before must also be a wild ride because you raised money with the company just getting off the ground in the last 2 years do you need accounting most email experiments are worthless the amount of times that I see people split testing 11 different cold email campaigns and then sometimes I see these posts and I pay these guys cuz I want to know what are you doing that I might not be doing and then we go under the hood and what they're really testing is would you like to have a chat next week versus would you happen to be interested in this that makes no difference in your campaign objectively if they're interested in your offer it doesn't matter what you're saying on the CTA there and that's not a real test when you're doing testing you want to be actually testing a hypothesis about your Market that's repeat heatable does it matter that you're reaching out to a Director of Finance and speaking about this feature or another feature does it matter that you're reaching out to a CFO versus a VP of Finance instead does it matter that the company is hiring people does it matter that you talk about this feature with this case stud or do people not even care about the case study anytime we're thinking about campaign experimentation we're always thinking about the first principles of our copyrighting strategy which mainly come down to the five offers in the world how do you help people save time make money or save money and then the other two is how do you raise the status and how do you help them live longer then if you create copywriting around those things split test those against different list topics as well too and then off those big three offers you should also be testing the so what we save time so you can do this other thing we help you make money so you can do this we help you save money so you can do this and so simply put just again when you're running your campaign experimentation put an actual reason behind the thesis not just changing around the words change up the offer and how you're messaging the offer change the so what and then also change how you're communicating your value proposition your pain points your case I and those kinds of things here's how your outbound campaign should change if you have a small Tam if you're a company with a tam of say less than 20,000 people that you can easily find on LinkedIn you're going to have to approach your campaigns much differently than if you have a very large t for these kinds of campaigns we highly recommend on the channel messaging and not just Omni channel that software companies talk about where they're just doing cold email and Linkedin that's just buy Channel Omni Channel we're talking about cold email cold calling LinkedIn and Direct Mail what we have found when we did some work with a private Equity company in the past one of the port folio companies had a small Tam and they said okay we want to set up an experiment our Tam is small we want to see should we hit these people in all of the channels and what Cadence should we hit them in so we first tried cold emailing people the first day and then we tried cold calling them 3 days later and then we sent them a direct mail a week later and then we emailed them again and then we linked and messaged them and and all of the things kind of threaded together and then in another experiment we just cold called everybody all in one go and then we cold emailed everybody in one go and then everyone that was left we did a LinkedIn message and then everyone that was left at after that that was still worth reaching out to we did a direct mail campaign you got a higher response rate when you did the threading and you did the email and then you cold called them the next day and all these things but the response rate was marginal in comparison to the Omni Channel messaging of just doing cold calling all at the same time cold emailing all at the same time and then going down the line now the reason I think this happens is because I don't really think that people care that they got a call from you one day and then they got an email from you the next day and then they got a LinkedIn message if anything I think that might annoy more people there's just people who respond to cold calls there's people who respond to hold email there's people who respond to direct messaging and there's people who respond to direct mail and those are all different kinds of people when you have a small Tam you need to make sure that you're hitting them on all of these different channels because you need to make as much use of your Tam as you possibly can the amount of horsepower SAS software that you have to pay for just the thought process to perfectly sequence people email LinkedIn cold call whatever that might be in my past I've never seen that actually be worth the effort because of all the stress that's going to cause you to try to get it perfectly right when you're on the channel marketing these people do one channel exhaust that Channel hit everybody up again on the next Channel hit everybody up again on the next Channel and then use Direct Mail last cuz it's the most expensive but if you have a small Tam that's a good way to use outbound marketing recently joined the company our most successful trigger of 2023 this is of course a classic and it was a great one in 2023 to be able to email people as soon as they join a company and say hey congrats on the new role as you're taking over this role I'm sure you're going to try to shake up the company you know we can help you do that would you want to talk in 2023 and even into 2024 that's been a really reliable signal for us I'll never forget one of my customers and 2023 received an email after they shortly joined the company and they said oh my gosh they definitely manually wrote this one this was amazing it's so timely you know can we do this as well too I said oh of course we can do this this is super easy clay makes this extremely easy I think it's a signal everyone should try in my agency this is one of the triggers that we actually have all of our customers try so even though I'm saying it's the best signal of 2023 it's a little bit used I don't know what more of a shelf life it has but it still gets great responses in 2024 and you should be using it for your trigger campaigns social signals the greatest trigger of all of 24 in all the campaigns that we ran in the past year social signals were the most successful for us this included engaging with people that recently posted on LinkedIn people who engaged with other people's LinkedIn content people that posted about certain topics it was all around just an amazing signal and it was one of the best that we put for all of our customers I'll tell you a story to really highlight this we were working with a company that was doing offshore Staffing and we ran six different triggers some of those triggers included the company was founded in the last 2 years and maybe they're going to need more people and they're growing quickly we also included that the person who who joined the company that we're reaching out to was a new hire our 2023 best signal we also included does this company already hire International talent and we also included a signal for does this company not include a hiring International talent and that way we had messaging for all of them but one of our signals was also if we detected that they posted on LinkedIn all we would do we would say hey I saw your LinkedIn post about thing and we would summarize what their LinkedIn post was and if you're going to copy this play make sure you also filter out anybody who's posting political things just make sure you don't put that in your email and we got a better response rate when we reached out with the LinkedIn post and we were literally saying hey I saw your LinkedIn post about blah blah blah you should recruit one of our virtual assistants that's all we did and I know the gurus are going to hate this but I have the numbers and this worked better than all the relevant signals that you think would work we also were using campaigns where we were targeting people who were engaging with content and posting about certain keywords and those also were extremely high performers so as we go into 2025 we're extremely bullish to continue with social signals of LinkedIn posts and content engagement in all of our outbound campaigns how to structure your email C es I've gotten far too many emails where somebody sends me seven emails in a row and all of them are follow-ups via just a reply to and you know what that does that just reminds me of the six other times that I completely ignored your message the way that we sequence our messages at growth engine X is we always use about a 3 to 5 day delay in between emails candidly I don't think this matters at all you shouldn't follow up with people two days in between and I don't really have data that five is better but one day is definitely bad we also send an initial email and then we send a follow-up email and then we send a third email with a completely different subject line we know that our best response rates come from our first email in a sequence so we don't want to keep going and keep reminding them hey were the people you didn't respond to we want them to completely forget about that other sequence and if we talked about saving money in the first sequence we want to talk about how we can help them make more money in another sequence and completely shake up our offers successful email one Frameworks if you've been following any cold email Guru on LinkedIn I would say the most tried and true method that everyone almost agrees on is to use email 1 to initially introduce your offer first first line why you why now explain why you're reaching out to them R second line clearly explain your offer in as short as you possibly can and your third line show social proof that the person you're reaching out to isn't the first person you've ever sold to in your life and then on line four call to action some people are advocating for soft call to action could I send you more information about this is this interesting we go for would you want to chat next Thursday just because we're trying to generate leads here and we actually want to get that feedback this is how we structure a lot of our email ones when we first start campaigns add more context in email 2 Mark Twain famously said I would have written WR you a shorter letter but I didn't have the time I think about this all the time when we're doing cold email copyrighting the way we usually use email 2 is we think about all the things that we had to delete from email 1 that were great context and we move that to email 2 the reason we do this is cuz I know email 2 is going to be threaded to email 1 so we can use this to dive deeper to keep our email still short but add that more context that if they're interested they can scroll down and they can still see email one and the context is all there when we send email 3 we're going to have to reset but in email 2 use that to add the things you had to delete from email one that you really wanted to include make email three about lowering the friction for somebody to respond all right let's think about the psychology here you sent somebody email one they didn't care you added more context about how great your offer is and you added case studies and still they didn't care at this point they don't care they're not responding already what we want to do in email 3 is we want to lower the friction for them to respond there's implicit objections when you send somebody an email that you need to get over and we need to lower that friction if you say hey do you want to book a call about this they might not respond because they want to protect their time but they might be slightly interested and so we lower the friction by maybe sending some kind of lead magnet sending something else for free custom Loom audit whatever it might be lower that friction you've already hit them twice they're not responding come up with a different call to action to just get a handraiser instead of a booked meeting your breakup emails are ruining your email sequences when we think of a breakup email the amount of times I received a breakup email oh my gosh you haven't responded to me you must be getting chased by an alligator my stuff is so important there's only a reason why that you wouldn't respond to it I think a great frame of mind is Orin claf talks about how you need to have status alignment when you're selling something you are the expert you can help solve a problem you don't need to be begging people for a response so when we do a breakup email we are usually using it as a way to see if we're talking to the right person in the company we're not saying oh you haven't responded I'm never going to talk to you ever again bye we're not begging them we're just saying hey you might have been the wrong person is there somebody else in the company that we should be reaching out to bonus Clay is the only tool in the world that you can use to name other people in the department automatically and that's currently a pretty underutilized strategy so you can actually name other people in the department in a way that they're not used to see seeing in an automated cold email and we get tons of responses on those kind of things change the value propositions in your cold email sequence sometimes when I'm reviewing people's cold email sequences they keep talking about the same value propositions they don't switch to any other different pain points what you want to do is if they're not responding to the first value propositions switch it up they might not care about making more money they might only care about saving time because that's where they're focused on in their business so if you're first talking about saving money in your next email talk about how you can help them make more money or save time switch things up because what you think they might care about isn't exactly the same thing and you should meet them where they're at so what that's a question I often think to myself when a campaign isn't working we've thought about it we're helping people save time we're helping them save money nothing's working we've had campaigns where we literally say we can help you save 3 hours a month on your sales tax are you interested and that works for some offers that's as deep as you have to go if it's not working initially we want to take it a step further why do you care about losing weight well I care about losing weight so I can spend more time with my kids and I could live a healthier longer life why do you care about your CRM having full data inside of it well I'm paying these reps to sell not to just enter into spreadsheets all day and so you could say hey clay helps people keep all of their data up to date tons of platforms are saying that clay helps you keep all of your data up to date so your sdrs can spend more time actually selling far better value proposition so keep those value propositions in mind if that's not initially working break it down and talk about the so what don't use all your best content in email one this is a mistake I used to make especially when I first started my cold email career we would have all of this data and we would pack email one with all these automations I got your website traffic I got you know the new employee you just hired I got the keyword from your open job post stuff that all into email one email 2 and three nothing else was left and so then we had a great email one and then just generic follow-ups sometimes we'll hold some of that data back so that one it looks like we re- research the company and also we can change the messaging to be relevant in a different way how to use AI effectively I know AI is this big buzz word everybody thinks it's this new thing and it's going to revolutionize everything which it will but the more things change the more things stay the same often times I see people using AI just to use AI the way we use it think about what would you do if you were to manually reach out to this person and how can you work backwards and use AI to say the same thing when using AI show your work what I mean by this is sometimes when we send cold emails we're scraping data from multiple sources the more sources we're pulling into an email the more you're actually putting yourself out there to be wrong and for some of the data to be incorrect what we used to do is we used to say hey from the numbers I see I'm assuming you get 50,000 website visitors per month we don't send that anymore because of the amount of people who came back to me one person even said he said is the point of this email to be so wrong about our web traffic that I respond and I just never forgot about that and so what we do is we show our work now and so we will say hey I was doing a research on similar web and they said you have 50,000 site visitors so now it's not us we were doing our homework we were looking into it and similar web is the person who's wrong and we could also say hey crunch Bas told me that this was true about your company or G2 said this when you're using Ai and you're scraping data from sources when you can show your work so that the more that you put out there the prospect sees that you did the research but if it's wrong they don't blame you they blame the data company I was wrong about this this AI strategy in 2024 I had a great idea I thought we were going to add in PS lines where we would create an analogy between our company and what we did and then the company that we were reaching out to to give Clarity on our offer and add some relevance what I found is that when we get personalization right people respond and they say oh my gosh thank you you're the first person to send me an actually personalized email really appreciate it yes let's book a call that's usually the kind of response we get I don't think I've ever gotten somebody to positively respond and say something about the analogy I even send emails to local business owners and we'll call out a local restaurant and we'll say hey we think this local restaurant's great have you ever tried it before we'll have people completely ignore the message that we sent and then they just talk about how much they love that restaurant so when we send these personalizations I know that they're working based on the way that people are reacting I never gotten a reaction to the analogy I was wrong and I'm sorry mention customer case studies in your outbound emails Cent has really changed the game of the kind of data that you can collect for your outbound campaigns one of our favorite things to do is collect the case study off of the custom custom website if there's a way that we can directly tie it to the offer we'll do that or we'll make a nice PS line because nobody really knows that you can automate this kind of research and it really makes your outbound email stand out so let's say we're trying to sell advertising services and we say hey notice that you worked with intercom in the past and you help them with XYZ you really want to include that so it looks really relevant what you then can say is how are you getting more customers like this what's your plan to close another Enterprise deal like intercom something to connect the dots about how your advertising Services could help them do that and that's just one thought there's tons of ways you can tie in case studies and then if there's no way for you to tie in the case studies sometimes I even like to just send a PS line hey if we never connect I saw the case study of how you guys helped intercom do XYZ really impressive Kudos even if we never meet don't use AI to write your entire email one of the things that I see people still trying to do is they're using open AI claw whatever it might be to write their entire email when that's not really necessary one you're not totally sure what it's going to output on the other side and two you don't need it to Output everything you want to be control of your messaging so you can split test things and understand what's really working often times in this previous part of this video we said we want to mention a case study I don't need AI to say I saw the case study on your website about I don't need AI to generate that we can keep it a static text we don't need it to all create that we can focus all of our horsepower all of our energy into prompting into just getting that AI line as good as we possibly can and we don't have to focus about all of the other things this was Eric nski from growth engine X if you like these 25 topics we can do a part two for 25 more\#\# Date Posted: 2024-08-01

\# Beginner's Guide to Clay Integrations

in my opinion the reason why so many people think Clay is difficult to use is because not only do you have to onboard yourself to understand how to use clay you also have to onboard to all of the different Integrations that clay has to offer so in this video what we're going to do is I painstakingly made a copy of all of the Integrations that are available in clay and we're going to go over all of them and my favorite uses of them some of them might be quick some of them we might get into but we're going to roll through them this is the most important part of clay is you just have to know what is at your fingertips right because zapier see seems like it's super easy but it's the same thing the only difference is you go to zapier and you say I want to connect my HubSpot account with Google Sheets so you know I'm typing in HubSpot and I'm typing in Google Sheets but when you want to find people hiring for open rols now they make that really easy in the clay interface but if you're hiring if you want to find people who are hiring for open rolls then that gets a little bit tougher so we are going to go through all of them and I'm going to give away this document so that you can see all of the Integrations as of July 24th uh 2024 and you can use this as kind of a reference you could watch this video to go through and everything so let's jump in it's already been a minute so with a table all these are super easy this is just you you know how this is the you could upsert a record look up a record or create a record if you don't know upsert means that if the record exists it will a automatically update it and if the record does not exist it will automatically create it so as opposed to just creating a record if you want to keep updating a record if it's the same thing you got to be using upser but anyway anthropic just another AI model amazing appify this is an integration that gives you access to the appify marketplace of scrapers that could be its own video you should just check it out they have amazing scrapers on the appify marketplace my only tip with using appify is try to use scrapers that are supported by the appify team so that you always are going to be able to get support and then apollo.io this is super easy it's just an integration with apollo.io Cent so clent is an AI that is connected to the internet that you can use on each row to be able to do custom research live about a company or a person and so uh it might be obvious if you use clay before but that's essentially what it does if you've never used clay before that's the thing that if you need to find the last podcast somebody was on or the pricing page of a website or the name of a company that they that a company has sold to in their case studies clent is the the tool for you to be able to use right there bra data this is actually a web scraping platform as well but not many people use it it we don't have to get into it builtwith this is how you can find technology installed on people's websites if you have never heard of builtwith before it's a great platform to figure out all of the users of Shopify and all of the users of clearbit and all these different things you have to understand though how the sausage is made so builtwith is really great when you are looking for technologies that are installed on somebody's website because that's how they're getting their data they're pinging the website seeing what technologies show up when the website loads and then they're saying okay they're using this software or this software this software so something like Shopify is very easy to find for built with because you build your whole website on Shopify uh if you're looking for platforms like QuickBooks you not get as many hits because people don't install Quickbooks on their website most often you're going to have to check the job descriptions instead and in those situations predict leads is going to be better for you but anyway uh Capa Capa is a platform that gives reviews for software and their categories and things like that use this to get ratings and reviews and everything it's brought to you by zenr so they're scraping it with Zen Rose it's not actually like Capa gave them a sanctioned uh integration so just keep that in mind this one we're going to spend a lot of time on Clay has a lot of Integrations that just help you do things for free that we could probably spend a ton of time on here and because this video purposely is supposed to go in depth we will do that so scoring uh leads inside of clay this is great for if you want to create some sort of lead scoring this is great for that so if you wanted to create some kind of formula where if the title includes Vice or VP and the industry is software and their company description includes real estate you want them to get a score of 100 amazing you could do that and then if none of those things exist you get a zero you could do that as well it it modulates really really well and you can just move things as needed for scrape website this is really great for finding phone numbers Social Links emails listed on a page the body text of a website really really great I used to use this a lot though and now I switch to zenr because it's just way cheaper to just use zenr versus using a clay credit to scrape the website but if you're just getting started it's great for getting the website content and then the emails listed on the page so if somebody has their email address listed on their website it scrape website is really good for pulling those kind of things uh HTTP API just a great way to just integrate any action with clay for free and then we have find keywords this is really great for finding keywords in a body of text so I'll use this for if we were looking up job opening and we wanted to see if the position was remote I might put in all of the the job description and then look for keywords around remote hiring or something like that then I'll get the rows that are remote and which ones aren't and then you could go on with your workflow from there extract URLs and emails from text I often use this when I'm integrating platforms so sometimes when we're sending data into clay it's sometimes difficult to get the URLs and the emails out of the text and everything and so um it's this you could just send a Big Blob of text and if you want the email address from that Big Blob of text or the URL from that Big Blob of text it works really well for instance uh if you integrate rb2 with uh clay and you're just using the free version when you send data from RB Tob in the slack Channel and you send it to Clay it's a little bit tough to parse that data you could just use this really quick to get the website and the LinkedIn profile and all these things check if URL is valid that's just what it is uh normalize a domain so normalizing a domain sometimes domains will come from data sources and it'll just be growthin x.com or it'll be ww. engine x.com or it'll be https you know colon backback www.g x.com and so uh normalizing a domain will just make all the domains exactly the same I usually use it to make sure that every ww dot just turns into just a bare growth engine x.com domain but that's just normally what I use it for J email permutations this is just if you wanted to try to guess somebody's email addresses and then use zero bounce to guess it yourself I don't use it that often detect language of text exactly what it sounds like identify email type and extract company domain from email this is really great if you want to make sure that you're not emailing Yahoo email addresses or you're not emailing Gmail or just free Gmail uh free email addresses in general this is a really great integration it does it for free and you can make sure you're only reaching out to business emails or you could remove business emails whichever one you would want but that uh does it really really well and uh yeah predicting the agender exactly what you might think score words in a list this just counts up how many times uh like if words are in a list how many times and you give it a score and all these things calculate the similarity of text this is really great when you have company names and you need to compare the two of them I don't use it that often I think I've used it once but anyway find common tags I've never used either so that can be interesting HTTP API with JWT authentication this is how you integrate Zoom info with Clay format category categories based on keywords so you can create categories based on you know if marketing is in existence you could create a marketing category if sales an existence you could create a sales category order a list again if you want to take a list of um like if you use the find people integration and you've got a list of 10 LinkedIn profile outputs you can re order them by the titles that you want to Target so you could prioritize you know CTO and then if you don't have a CTO you prioritize CEO and then if you don't have a CEO you prioritize you know head engineer or whatever it might be normalize and D duplicate a list kind of the same thing map a job title to a Persona again kind of the same thing as the format categories based on keywords but again you can format them and say okay you know if they have Marketing in their role it's a marketing persona if they have sales in the role sales Persona you know all those things look up single Row in other table look up multiple rows in other table this functions very much the same as just a vlookup very very nice you know you can just use it to combine two tables together always make sure that your the the data that you're unifying the rows by is the most common data point so often times that'll be a website so you might say I've got a row with this website over here and I've got another table with that website in it you would use uh this kind of like a vlookup to be able to combine that data together find site map URLs for a company website this is great to just see one how many how big is their sitemap but then two you can use it to find their pricing or their careers page or whatever you might do and then you know further enrich on top of that filter list of objects this is actually one I use quite a bit this is great to if you've got a long list of like uh company experiences from somebody's personal profile then what you can do with this if you want to see which ones are still current you can use this one to filter all of them for only the current ones and then you'd be able to figure out what they list as their current experience extract values from data kind of like find keywords extract field from object similar but it's only for objects and I'd have to show you clay to show you that um categorize based on keyword like all these things you'd have to kind of be in clay a little bit more uh and you'd have to have a specific use case just let you know I don't ever use these things so there you go find mobile number and social URLs this is just uh clay integration that combines multiple data sources it's probably the cheapest mobile phone number uh provider on the platform clay form matters you can normalize phone numbers normalize company names this also lets you if uh a company name is in all caps it'll normalize it for you and do that kind of stuff formatting date and time we use all the time as well too WR to other table this is one that everyone everyone should know about right to other table so if you have some Integrations will give you 10 of the same like if you're looking for salespeople at a company and you get 10 salespeople from the find people integration right and what you could do is you could map all those people to different columns but if you want all of them to be in their own row right to other tabl is the way that you would do it so again say you've got you know 10 people in one integration column inside a clay you don't want to make them their own columns you want to make them their own rows right to other table is the perfect one for that these have been deprecated a little bit they don't work as well anymore I mean find redirect page totally works but find data from page I think they're working on that right now so don't worry about that too much clearbit is a great platform uh with really accurate data one to highlight here is finding domain from company name a lot of times when you're trying to find company data most databases work off of the domain so if all you have is company names clearbit is a great first step for you to enrich that company name into a website and then you can use cagent because this is free and then you could use cagent to find all of the missing gaps in that just a really great uh integration for that close is a CRM that if you're using that CRM a lot of these things would make sense to you I don't actually use Koda so I assume this is some kind of database or like air table um platform companies people jobs data this is uh a lot of this data is based off of LinkedIn data so find contacts at company this is how you can find you know all the salespeople at a company or whatever it might be find active job openings exactly like what it sounds like enrich person from profile you input one LinkedIn profile and you rich that enrich that person's LinkedIn profile really great again enrich uh company you input a domain or you input a LinkedIn company URL and you get all of the LinkedIn data back for them amazing find an enrich person from Google search this essentially creates an automated Google search where because if you were to search Eric no lowski founder growth engine X the first result is going to be my LinkedIn profile so if you don't have people's LinkedIn profiles but you have their name and their title or you have their name and their company this is a great way to go hunt those people down find employee headcount by criteria you can use this to find all the people who recently joined the company in the last six months you could find this to see how many support team members they have tons of different things find employee head Camp by country exactly what it sounds like find recent posts by user or company finds LinkedIn posts from a user URL or a company URL find company headcount growth exactly what it sounds like find company lookalikes they built their own model to find lookalikes to companies in your table contact out great data provider mobile numbers personal emails their personal email data is very very very good customer Io if you use customer IO this makes sense to you dap radar this is for crypto stuff dagma again this is another just data provider for work emails they've got great mobile numbers although it's expensive it's also an alternative to find employees at companies and enrich the people and the companies and things like that if you have your own dagma API key this could be more cost-effective to do LinkedIn searches through dagma than it is on the clay platform just something for you to know debounce is an email verification platform deep l i don't use uh drop contact exactly what it looks like email data provider find work email all those things en richly validate emails find email same thing just in an email provider actually a very good email provider don't get me wrong forager you can use to find phone numbers GitHub you can use this to look up details about a repo or a user uh from GitHub glass store you can enrich a company with their glass ST reviews and their ratings and all those different things Google searches this is one of my favorite things check out my video uh on Google search operators Google has built the largest scraper in the world and with Google search operator you could just take advantage of it um so you could do a lot of things with Google automated Google searches that automate a lot of account research namely finding keywords and making sure they're on websites so for example if you want to look up a list of law firms and see which law firms do uh Workforce Employment law or wrongful termination Law whatever it might be you can autom make Google searches to get that done their open jobs data is okay it just doesn't normalize that well just because I think when you scrape Google Google jobs sometimes it'll have fulltime in one position and then it'll have the job title in that same position so it doesn't come back normalized all the time um finding the business reviews is really great with this integration but mostly I use the perform search over here finding the domain for a company name gets a little hairy Cent is just far better and cheaper to do that Google Gemini just an AI platform uh Google News exactly what it sounds like Google page speed this just pings a website to just see how fast the website loads for SEO people this is good Google Scholar you know this is just for looking up you know scholarly articles I never use this Google shopping I like using this when we're looking at e-commerce Brands to see if they have Google shopping set up and then we use this to name the products really well so if you use cagent and you say hey go find products from this website it works but it doesn't work amazingly well like sometimes it screws up and so uh with this you can just get very def definitive shopping results from the website and it works really well uh so when we're targeting e-commerce Brands and we want to name a product we'll use Google shopping and then use AI past the Google shopping to get that Google translate exactly what it sounds like Hacker News again exactly what it sounds like you can find posts you could find users whatever it might be harmonic is probably one of the best company data providers uh out there if you have access to them great but most people don't have access to them you can get the fundraising data for the company uh actually you can do both with Clay credits so it's really good data it's kind of expensive but it's very good data heyre is a platform that automates your LinkedIn Outreach uh for you and you could add leads to your campaigns straight from clay into hey reach hit Horizons exactly what it says finding a Mia company for graphics HubSpot exactly what it sounds like Hunter again an email validation platform ICP same thing Instagram it finds the company profile I usually just use zenr for this and or cayen I I don't really waste clay credits on something like this instantly is a platform that automates your cold email campaigns and you can add leads to those campaigns uh this is a data provider that gives you fundraising data this is L growth machine is a great like sales engagement platform they do email they do LinkedIn they do uh calling I think maybe but L growth machine is very good you can use lavender to rate your emails lead magic again validate emails find work emails find Mobile numbers we've done some testing with lead magic and the data is really really really great uh on that one linear I never really use lob it's just for validating um addresses if you're trying to do Direct Mail campaigns lob is really good for that then you have uh locko this is really great for uh recruiters so if you're a recruiter you could do a lot there uh madudu get Company lead score from email I'm pretty sure you need to have your own account for this to work though because madkudu doeses like lead scoring but they do it based off your preferences so I'm pretty don't quote me on that I never use this integration but that's what it might look like map box you can normalize the location and then you can find distance between two locations we've done this before if we wanted to invite people to an event and we wanted to make sure that their LinkedIn profile location was within 50 miles so you could use mapbox honestly you could use AI to do the same thing though uh AI knows where the locations are and how far they are mix rank find personal email enrich person from email this would I think it enriches them from a person personal email though uh the personal email data is pretty good never bounce validate your emails Awesome nimbler Again a mobile personal or a work email finder ocean. great lookalike company research really really really great lookalike company research open AI This Is My Chosen weapon of generating text I know everybody's like oh like you know Claude is so much better at this or anthropic is so much better at this I just don't care I just keep using open AI it's just the way that it is Outreach so if you use the Outreach sequencer there's an integration for that owler you can use owler data to find company competitors find company updates enrich the company this is actually using an owler API it's very expensive I would rather just scrape the owler um scrape the owler page with zenr and you get a lot of the same data back so just quick tip people data Labs again find personal emails they also are a mobile data uh mobile number data provider so that works really well for that Phantom Buster kind of like appify whole Suite of scraping products that you can use check them out definitely use some of the stuff it's Phantom Buster is very very great pipe drive if that's your uh weapon of choice for crms amazing pitchbook again if you want to if you like pitchbook data you can enrich it with uh zenr and it's really great predict leads okay this one will spend a little bit of time on predict leads is really really great they really nail these things I find fine connections to be okay but find most recent news find Tech and find open jobs is really really great so the clay company people jobs database a lot of that I mean it's a mixture of databases but a lot of it's coming from LinkedIn data predict leads I know for a fact they're using multiple databases but where they're really getting their data from is the career page of the website so when you combine the clay one with the predict leads one you're getting a lot of really great coverage for the fine Tech stack I think they're doing some website scraping but they're also looking in job descriptions to see if people mention certain Technologies in their job descriptions so this one is even better so nobody installs Quickbooks on their website but you can use predict leads to see who's using QuickBooks based on past job descriptions when they say Hey you know we're hiring this accountant and you have to know how to use QuickBooks great find most recent news this is just a really great news API uh I like it better than Google News because it just comes back structured every time and they've got some really good categories for like uh finding that a companies that are opening new offices finding if the company's launching a new product finding if new leadership came in all this stuff it works really really well prosio this is our weapon of choice for finding work emails so I use them a ton we also use find email addresses associated with a domain for local business scraping all the time retention. comom great personal email finder from a LinkedIn URL really really really great Salesforce if you're using Salesforce or sales Loft all of these are at your disposal here uh scrape magic I don't think this exists anymore and it's just an integration Sam rush if you want to get traffic analytics uh but I check out some of my other YouTube videos we just scrape similar web uh with zenr in order to do this so I don't use the sem Rush integration that often s spark you can add a prospect to a video campaign this is great it'll output the link and then you can send that to your instantly or smart lead campaigns super great Shopify again you can find the products and you can check the store status the BET like I when I I don't really use this because we just use the Google shopping one instead signal hire this is great for recruiters slack we often use this so that if we're sending data into clay and then we get it enriched and we want to be notified about it we'll use the slack integration for that smart lead again our weapon of choice for our cold email campaigns today I checked in and this month so far we've sent like 1.1 million cold emails with smart lead and I don't know when our billing period is up so we Hammer a lot of emails out of smartly love that platform again another email tool if you use snowflake this is what's going on over here store leads store leads is a really great database for e-commerce uh companies if you only need to enrich like 500 rows use clay credits but if you're going to do more than that definitely get your own API key and sign up for the platform because it's a flat fee and then it comes with unlimited data but store leads has really really great e-commerce data not only in sourcing e-commerce companies but then also enriching those e-commerce companies I've never used the stripe integration inside of clay some I've seen some things about this and I have to check it out more um swordfish I'm pretty sure this is really good for recruiters and finding personal data Tavis again generating videos Twain this writes very good sales emails from the API little bit expensive for us to be using it inside of clay but it does write very good sales emails type form again you could just you're using it like if somebody fills out a type form it'll just send the response to the clay table Yelp this is great for finding local businesses and their reviews Zen Rose I'm a big advocate for them as you could tell in this video we use them to scrape a ton of stuff and then zero bounce is another email validation platform so um anyway I hope you enjoyed this overview hopefully I gave you a quick idea of what's available inside of clay and I hope this video wasn't boring for you um this just gives an overview of what we use some of these Integrations for and some of my favorite things and if you're new to Clay hopefully it starts giving you ideas of what you can do in clay as well so uh thanks for watching\#\# Date

\# Creative Prospecting Ideas that Boost Replies with Clay

all right so we are live and even if I'm not live I'm just going to keep going because I know it's being recorded and we'll figure all of that out later and so you'll notice that it's just me today and the reason being is because I am going to go over how we use clay in my agency growth engine X in order to create higher response rates all the time clay customers come in and they say okay this sounds amazing but what's going to be the results on our response race and my response to that is always well it depends on how good your ideas are um I could say that there's a lot of ways that you can increase the response rate that you're getting on your campaigns but that being said it really has to come down to product Market fit so uh instead of making a guarantee to people and saying okay hey you I guarantee your response rates will go up I'm just going to overwhelm you with examples of when I have used clay in order to have response rates increase on campaigns for my clients I won't name any of them because this is a clay broadcast and not a growth engine x uh podcast so if anybody you know is like why is he not naming company names it's because I don't have the permission in this context and we don't have to get into that too much I will also show you the basics of how we built it I'll probably create like a gigantic clay table to be able to make this happen uh and we can jump into it from there so the first thing we're going to do is I'm going to present my screen so everyone can see and here we go uh yeah so we're gonna see this one and we're just gonna start off with a template just so that we have some sample data to to work with and what I would say about this is the first one that we're going to go over is uh a little while ago I was helping private Equity companies reach out to small businesses to see if they would be willing to sell their small business to the private Equity company and so the data that we started with was either just Apollo data or we were scraping Google Maps and then finding uh email addresses from websites and things like that and uh because again these were locally owned businesses and the personalization that we added to this campaign in order in this particular case it's 3x to the positive response rate was extremely extremely simple all we did to this campaign is we added the phone number from their Google my business profile and we took a look at the location that they're located in and commented on a restaurant in the area so like I said the between the two of these things we increased the positive response rate by uh 3x and so I you know pretty great uh amount of leads and so the way that this happens is you just use the find business Google review information you can map in the company name which is is fine uh whoops but the website is the most important one and then we'll hit continue to add fields and then we could take the ratings those would help increase your response rate as well but I really need the phone number from here and then we'll take the address as well why not and then we are running this integration and so the way this kind of played out was we would basically reach out to people and say oh hey Mary I was just a call I was uh just trying to call you at 312-281-5175 but it seems like I missed you an email would be easier and then we would get into the pitch afterwards and this uh was one thing that we did to increase positive responses and like I said the other thing that we did is we called out a restaurant in their area which is personally one of my my favorite ones don't use this on SAS people um because they they see right through this kind of stuff but this one is is pretty fun so we're entering the address and we're just gonna put extra on it and Yelp domain that's interesting oh yeah that's just the country and then we're going to sort the results by highest rated so that we don't accidentally get like a Dunkin Donuts in here or something and then we'll put the title here and then we'll save and run those rows and so now this is running so basically the whole email would look like uh and maybe I should move these as we're talking about these things the whole email would look like hey uh hey Sam I was just about to call you at 888-330-6942 uh but you know I couldn't get through so I imagine you know would be easier and then we would just pitch them on if they'd want to sell their business or not and then we put a PS line and we would say oh hey by the way Sam I noticed you're located in the San Francisco area have you ever heard of paellas and codes and that was basically the email that we would send and so we will publish a blog post on this and I will have the uh campaign results on it and this did increase the campaign results by about 3x on the positive responses so this was a really awesome simple way no AI needed pretty scalable uh way to increase these uh responses and so the other one that we would do as well is if you ever reach out to local businesses local businesses are sometimes pretty tough because they don't have a good LinkedIn profile presence and when they don't have a LinkedIn profile presence oftentimes it's difficult to tell who the founder of the company is and you know who's in charge because and then you might even be emailing like contact app Pest Control company.com and and those aren't very great to reach out to so in these situations we also have a different Playbook where we're going to combine a lot of this data but the big thing that we're going to add on is we're going to add on their ratings so we would add their ratings to the email and basically you need to act like a little bit of a lost puppy and so these are pretty low because um these are pretty low because these are all software companies but local businesses would have more robust ratings over here and so basically now we would change the email of instead of reaching out to Sam I would say you know to whom it may concern or I'm you know I am trying to find for the founder of the company we started off in any of those ways the reason I'm reaching out is because I saw that you have a five-star rating across one review or really we you know we'd probably X these out and be like oh you have a five star rating across six reviews the one review one wouldn't really work and so we probably exclude that and so we'd say oh you have a five-star rating across six reviews um and I noticed that you're located you know in Austin and so I just wanted to see if you'd potentially be open to selling your business as I have some buyers who are looking for you know people in this area um we would kill the restaurant in this case because we have no clue who we're reaching out to and where they're going um so we would we would basically just like I said keep it pretty high level and just pretend to be a little lost and be completely honest and keep it really casual um and so that's what we would do for some local Outreach again if you were to just send a kit send a campaign where it was just you're reaching out to info at Pest controlcompany.com and just pitching them um I think we got no responses when we did that and then here we got um uh not as many results as when we got had the person's first name but uh you know way way better results than not having the person's first name like I I think there's not even x that you put it on because it didn't work before for the contact at pest controlcompany.com but then it worked when we added in all of this data um so I think overall we found 105 pest control companies that wanted to sell when it came to having their first name in the email and we knew we were reaching out to the owner and then I think we found like 65 companies that wanted to sell when we just had the contact email address so you can derive those results from yourself and then when we were emailing the contact email address with none of this data I don't think we had anybody email us back um so that is another pretty good example another one is um looking for keywords on somebody's website and so I've used this in two instances one I've used this to determine what type of company a company is within a niche and so what I mean by that is one time I was helping somebody uh contact lawyers and they only wanted to speak to wrongful termination lawyers and they gave us a bunch of other keywords as well and so um the other one we did was around CSV Imports and CSV uploads um and we could kind of talk about the stats that come from that but so we had we'll talk about the legal one first and so basically what we were doing is we came in and we were using Google where is it we use the search Google one and we had our search query and so I basically said like site and then we took their website and then I was looking for a whole host of keywords but I just put wrongful termination right here and then we'll put one result because I really don't need a whole lot and then we'll take let's see let's take the snippet and then we'll search their their websites which it'd be kind of funny if there's room full termination so now what we would do is uh this is funny where is this on of the agreement okay yeah that makes sense and so now what would happen is we have this list of 10 000 lawyers and we would Whittle that list down to only the ones that mentioned wrongful termination and then we reached out to those people because the the pitch obviously had something to do with wrongful termination and so um again this was actually a campaign that I think we were getting like a 0.5 positive response on but we were getting a lot of spam complaints because there were a lot of people who did not deal with wrongful termination and our open rates were suffering pretty significantly so this isn't one of those cases where we are getting zero results but we're definitely having a tough time with the results and so when we scored all of the companies that we knew that they actually mentioned wrongful termination that actually turned it into a 11 positive response rate Campaign which um you could probably extrapolate that like you know the 0.5 was the a similar response rate if we were actually targeting the people who actually mentioned around full termination all we did here is just make the list a lot smaller and more refined and then go after those people uh but again in order to do this research manually would take a ton of manual effort and so we were able to use clay to make this happen candidly the list was not huge I think we ran it to probably a about 400 lawyers in New Jersey and then after that the campaign was over so very small campaign I do want to put that out there um then when we did it for the CSV Imports and CSV uploads we actually have data side by side of because we still send an email if they're a SAS company and they don't mention CSV uploads and then we send an email if they mention CSV uploads and there if they do mention CSV uploads we are getting a boost in response rates that one I don't want to put out into the public right now because I might get that number wrong follow up on the blog post when I when I have these numbers in front of me but when we like I said when we compare it to we haven't found anything on their website to when we do uh we get really good positive responses somebody actually took that email and they posted it on LinkedIn as one of the best emails that they've they've ever received when uh we found CSV Imports on their website and we get tons of you know Kudos in the in the emails about it as well that I can share so that was another one that we used clay to basically boost response rates uh from there then uh this has become kind of a staple in the agency where this one is boosting positive response rates at pretty uh pretty uh explicitly and so let's just use this what we're doing with this one is I'm taking the description of the company and I am uh taking the description company and creating a summarization or a mission statement for what this company does and then I'm able to put this into the email and so all in order to make this uh it is very simple and I apologize if you're watching the live stream and this might be a little boring but the way that we do this is It's just using the input uh summarize what the company does and how they help people this is whoops this is the input and then we're going to go like that and now we're going to put description oops not bad and now we'll take their description uh and then I'll say like keep the output under eight words and use specific any words from the input please each prompts with my prefix and do not output any quotation marks any video results this is my prefix I was on ignore website and it looks like you help blah blah and so then this line we can create we can hit continue to add Fields again we have data for this line basically um the case study I would have for this line is that we have a customer who runs a marketing agency that they have great case studies for that how they can help um other companies but they were getting a okay response rate I think it was at like a 1.5 uh positive response rate which is you know by all means necessary pretty damn good um but then what we did is we added this AI line to make them feel like we were actually researching them and then we took it to about like a 3.2 uh positive response rate if I can remember that off the top of my head and so this just simple line will increase your your responses because it looks like you actually looked up their website there's a couple big companies like you know aurum and you know other companies that I heard of that they literally have people just writing with these lines and so now you can just use artificial intelligence to get this done you don't even have to have these lines say this precisely you saw how I set it up you have the prefix and you can have it say specific things I would even sometimes set it up to be like okay you're you know analyzing all these Banks how is this Bank different than regular Banks this is what a regular Bank does you know how does this Bank differentiate itself from other Banks and then you can turn that into a line so you know a lot of things to be done here as well I don't think any of these companies are totally like ones that we would all know about but if we look at like checkley right build and run uh synthetic monitoring that scales monitoring as code workflow for developers okay great so what does it say that they do I was on your website it looks like you helped developers with scalable synthetic about it awesome okay that I think that Nails it pretty well um the next thing I think this one this one uh we use in the agency currently and if so I guess I would compare this to if I were to send an email to somebody and say hey I run a outbound agency um I can help you get more leads do you want me to help you get leads um that would be the alternative of being able to send to the campaign I'm about to show you of which their you know there's no positive responses on that one with this we basically get three positive responses a day using this one and so what this is is I am using Chachi Boutique to analyze a company's description and then give uh outbound campaign ideas and based off of that company description and so um I'm trying to think of how if there's any other explanation to that so and I can just I guess I'll just jump into exactly how it works so basically we would have like four messages and so we would be like user using the input and actually I'm going to try to find another cable where I do this because this is uh this is a huge prompt please bear with me basically we're going to say using the input come up with three creative uh marketing ideas for this company they have to be possible with outbound marketing um and you know here's the input and so then we would type in a description and then we'll give it some other creative constraints I would call it and then once we get all of that done here yeah let's do this and then once we get all of that done we can kind of run it and let it fly so we have this one using the input create blah blah blah keep each bullet point under this and you know all these things be specific great and then we're going to set up the assistant where I'm going to teach it hey this is what I want your outputs to look like and then we'll have the user again but now my user is going to be the real output that we're going to use which is the description oh whoops yep so then we have the description here and actually we don't need the fourth one um I I actually in my real prompt I have 10 of these going back and forth because I want it to be really good and I gave it a lot of examples but this would also work as well so then we'll hit this and then we'll run and so what this is going to do is give these companies outbound campaign ideas right so this company it helps you with breach prevention right and let's see what outbound ideas they gave us okay so we'll move to another one I was on your site it looks like you helped manage and protect Microsoft infrastructure so awesome so Target it managers involved in Cloud migration offering tailored solutions to simplify their transition reach out to csos or security managers highlighting chaosoft security Appliance benefits and email Microsoft certified prevention uh professionals emphasize some compatibility with Microsoft environments and increase efficiency and so this is taking a campaign basically what we're doing here is reaching out to these companies and saying uh hey if I had a chance this is how I run your outbound marketing ideas are you doing any of these right now and do you need to help automating any of them or do you need help starting any of them is basically the way that we're framed again and I have no social proof in the email I have no offer in the email I have no guarantee in the email it kind of like breaks all of the rules of a legion agencies uh outbound prospecting and basically we just send this in the email and we send about 300 emails a day and we book about like two meetings a day off of this which is you know more than I even want to take anyway and it's highly scalable right because we're only at 300 emails a day so we could really ramp it up if we wanted to and what I would say is any person who has a product or a service that can be used creatively and the way that everyone uses your product or service is different could benefit from this so if you're like a you know how to try to think of if you're one of these uh tools for engineers and you do one thing and that's what you help Engineers do then this play wouldn't really work that well for you but if you are clay and there are tons of creative things that companies can do uh you know with your product this is a great way to take your value proposition and plant it into a company and what they're doing and so that they can like imagine how your product would help them and again this works for services really well too you know if you provide a service where you just clean somebody's gutters then you know this isn't going to work but if you provide a service that has some creativity elements to it again this is gonna uh work really really well and so I don't even have a before and after for you because people watching this if you're a legion agency owner you know the response rates if you were to just say oh hey I could get you leaks you want leads we help people get leads you know the response rate on that email is really low and then for the people who are watching this that don't run an agency you get these emails all the time but you probably roll your eyes at it so this is kind of the level up from that that we would send um and so now on to the next one the next one that we did was and this would require like a different setup here but what we did was um we took a company that we were actually running campaigns for them and we are getting very very little results and they needed to capture demand extremely quickly and they came to us and they were saying hey this isn't working you know we really need to think of something a lot faster and I said okay you know let's go back to the drawing board today how do you acquire customers and they said well we acquire customers basically through our CEO posting organic content on LinkedIn and then we take action on the people who come inbound I said okay well what if we were to reach out to all of uh his connections that meet certain criteria and then um you know Target those people specifically to see if we could just speed up the amount of um demand that we could generate by going straight to them and putting a direct offer in their inboxes and they said sure let's do it and so basically the first thing that we did was we just took out all of the people that um are connected with them and that we're already customers because we we wanted to definitely take those people out then the next thing that we did is we just used the uh get keywords function inside of clay and we were looking for keywords around like Human Resources oh whoops Human Resources um training team development that's not a good one but anyway that's what we're doing and then we take the text body to search and the text body to search that we were using was on their LinkedIn profile and so we would take their summary and we would see if anybody has those keywords in their summary and then that's how we basically scrub the list of 30 000 followers broke it down to 1500 people that we should we should reach out to and that campaign probably has the highest uh positive response rate uh of a campaign as far as like emails sent and then the amount of responses that we got and then the amount of positive responses that we got and like I said I I know we're on this live stream right now I'm not showing any proof for this please follow for the blog article the blog article is going to have all the proof for this I I promise I I don't like making these claims without uh saying so so I I you know I know that we got both over 100 positive responses in like a week and a half um I forget how many emails we totally sent and I will you know publish all of these things in in the blog post so this is another way that we use clay to basically look at big chunks of data and then break it down and then Target people uh by the right the right sense another really awesome story that I have really definitive proof of a before and after uh for a campaign that we ran and then we used clay in order to increase the response rate on that campaign was I was helping somebody who sells a software to real estate agents because real estate agents need to be on Facebook they need to be on Instagram they need to be on Twitter they need to be on ZipRecruiter or Zillow they need to be on realtor.com there's all these platforms that they need to manage that if somebody's going to do research on them they need to pop up if they need to have an active uh good looking profile and so they actually just needed help with just sending the email so they provided a lot of the leads list and they provided the um the copywriting that they wanted to use and so the campaign was going well I think we had like a 0.7 positive response rate and like I said everything was going well um but I said hey I think we would be able to make this a lot better and the way that we made it better is again we went back to uh the Google search but now instead of searching on a particular site like before when we're doing the wrongful termination we're only searching one site at a time in each row what we were doing instead now was we were Google searching the realtor's uh name there we'll take this we're Google searching the realtor's name and their company name um did I include anything else no we're just doing the realtor's name and company name because that was like maybe the most that somebody would probably Google about them as well and then I kept the results to five and so what we did here then was I went in and we did a keyword match again to see how many of these results included linkedin.com zillow.com realtor.com uh you know Instagram YouTube how many of these results include of the top five included links to social media sites that they need to be on and so then you could see very easily that we could just go into the search results and we could just extrapolate like okay this is LinkedIn or then we could extrapolate we could say this is you know their website this is crunchbase this is rocket reach and this is top i o networks or whatever or topio networks whatever this is and so we then did a keyword match and said okay are any of these Instagram are any of these LinkedIn or any of these Facebook or any of these YouTube all these things then we would get the account and say okay if of the top five links for that search four to five of them were Facebook YouTube Instagram or one of the Social Links they would get more of like a congratulatory message of hey you're doing this really well is that a lot to manage we could help you do this a lot better and then if they showed up in like two to three links they we would say hey you're doing okay would you want to improve your performance and then if they showed up at zero or one link that would basically be like hey you are not on there at all and you really need to be and so this was a pretty clear campaign like I said it was definitely like a point seven percent positive response rate and then we took it to a 2.7 positive response rate and so that was a huge difference in positive response rates but basically we were saying like hey I know you have that this problem or I know you're doing well at this and it probably is taking a lot of work for you to do well at this and then we've merged all of that together and with the the right messaging based on the data around uh the Googling and that's where we were able to get such a increase in positive responses and I think that's actually one of the best examples of uh taking like a campaign where it's just raw Data before and then injecting some clay practices into it and then we really boosted the positive response rates uh from there um another campaign that we ran that was kind of running a little bit flat was when we were reaching out as a fractional uh Chief Financial Officer for companies and basically well I I think it was like a 0.3 or a point five percent uh positive response rate the campaign was not doing phenomenally it was doing okay no it really wasn't that good the feature that we used in clay in order to boost the response rates on it was we went in and we found their LinkedIn profile so we had their company identifier and we used their URL here and then basically we wanted to find to see if they had any accounting pattern we basically wanted to see if they had any accounting or Finance person on the team because if they didn't we wanted to send them a message about hey it looks like you you know I took a look at your LinkedIn company page and you don't have any anyone who's monitoring this directly or I saw that you have a CFO or I saw that you have an accountant do you have anybody who's you know looking at things from this lens or something like that and so we would basically set this kind of campaign up and uh you know because it looked like we did so much more extra research on the company basically calling out the fact that they don't have a dedicated Financial professional who's a part of the team we again raise the response rates up and I'll publish these response rates uh when we do the plug we raise the response rates pretty significantly that now people are responding saying oh hey you know thanks for doing the research on the company we don't have this person or then they started admitting to us oh we're already using a fractional service or whatever it might be and it made the approach much much more conversational so if we were to run this I just want to show everybody kind of what the results would be so if we're looking for an accountant an accounting person you know whatever it might be we can get the amount of profiles that they have on the team and so like say we have a senior accounting that critical start we have a CFO a critical start we have a Director of Finance and we have an accounting supervisor awesome and so then we would call those people out and say like oh hey you know did this person's here these kind of things so uh yeah that was a another good example of campaigns that we were pretty easily able to upgrade on um let's see oh great another one see I'm just like keep rolling through these and I can probably do this all day is um mentioning their competitors so we were reaching out to SAS companies and calling out their competitors and saying like hey we just found this news about your competitor we saw that they're launching a new product we saw this that and the other thing basically we would use clay to First find the competitor and then after we use clay to find the competitor we would then um run an analysis against that competitor and so there's two Integrations that find competitors pretty well there's enriched Company by domain for G2 categories and then there's craft as well actually you basically just put in the domain here and then we'll put in the company name for higher accuracy and then we can jump in here and there's so much data about these people at craft.co is so great at doing this so we would have the competitor here and then we'll just take the first uh competitor so we'll do like display name and we'll we'll just take it from there so we know about their competitor and so we would run this we'd also run G2 as well and then we would just get an analysis on who their competitor is so we do this and I guess in this case we'd have to use oh wait no here it is all right so sisu data that's one of their competitors and so then we do an analysis and then take care of it uh from there and so then in the email we would call out and say like oh hey you know I just saw that slintel launched a new product how are you guys thinking about this and deploying like your next features of products we help people who are deploying these next features of products and things like that so this was a really good one as well um and then another one that people oftentimes they want to get this set up but they don't know how to set it up in the best way possible what I also will tell people to do is to search for all the people in the company that you want to Target by title so the CEO the founders the owners all those people and then you can run a separate find people integration where now you'll you'll put in the same uh you're going to put in the same criteria so let's say that we do like there's anybody in sales right so we'll put sales and then we'll put in months and start date or current role and we'll do three and so we're only searching for people who've recently started at this company and so we're looking for sales people who recently started at this company and now we would get these different lists where it's like okay here's everyone we can reach out to and here's all the new people they just joined they have budget they need to make decisions you know you could try to get this data in Apollo you could try to get in sales Navigator but it's a little tough here it's super easy you look into this person as like right director of sales enabling and they have been at the company since March 1st if you sell to directors of sales enablement uh that just joined the company mediafly just had Chris lard join the company and you should really be reaching out to them and so uh I hope this stream was pretty helpful I know I went through these examples pretty quickly but I basically wanted to try to overwhelm you with evidence about how you could take data that normally comes from Apollo seamless lead IQ Zoom info and it's just the data that they just give you and then you could change that data in clay and transform it into new things that can Empower your Outreach that makes your Outreach look more sophisticated thusly also getting a higher response rate from your prospects and so if you have any other ideas about this or you have any ideas you would like us to build just let us know and I'd be happy to take a shot at it for you but until then thank you for watching and you can always get more updates by joining us at clay.com backslash slack or you can go to clay.com to sign up for the product and we will get you off the waitlist so thank you all for joining me today and we'll talk to you soon bye\#\# Date Posted: 2024-11-30

\# AI Prompting Tips from Sending 1.5M Cold Emails Per Month

hey everyone in this video I'm going to be going over some of my tips or the way that I think about Frameworks on using AI prompting I'm not going to share my screen I'm just going to talk so I hope it's not that boring for you and uh I'm specifically coming at this from the angle of we send about 1.5 to 1.7 million cold emails every month and uh these are the tips that we use to send the the AI generated text in a lot of the emails and um I I thought about doing this video because a customer customer of mine was asking for some of the tips that I have for AI prompting and I said what are you talking about you know prompting is so easy there's no tips that I necessarily have about it this is just what I do and then I told them a four-step framework that we're going to go over and then I told him another tip and I told him another tip and I told him another tip and it kind of just hit me that I feel like we've discovered a lot of things when it comes to prompting AI specifically in the cold email use case and so I just wanted to make a video to go over all of these and so this isn't going to be a video about what's our favorite model and what do we do and all these things we send so many emails that 40 mini is just basically the only model that we use for for anything I know there's going to be people who say that Claude or anthropic is better for copyrighting and all these other things I find that the way that we prompt just makes that not necessary uh when you're talking about these different models you know when these models are tested they're tested against who which model can pass a high level legal exam or the CPA exam or or something at those high levels usually all I need this model to be able to do is take in information and then spit out the information without sounding like a robot it you know if you can't get 40 mini to be doing that and you're testing all the different AI models and things to see which one is actually doing that better I I just don't think that it's a good use of time it's just the cost aspect is why we use 40 mini for for almost everything when we're doing research in instead of outputting an actual message which we'll talk about later on sometimes we'll use 40 but for the most part we're using 40 mini so anyway to the useful stuff so our four-step framework for prompting AI is to First basically I we'll talk about how we use the system prompt and how we use the prompt and then how we use the examples that you can chain inside of the prompt specifically inside of clay uh but you could do it for any AI model that you're building when we're prompting there's four things that I try to do one I try to just generally tell artificial intelligence this is the objective that I want you to complete this is just the overall guidance of what I want you to do so step one is just overall just tell it what you want it to do step two is then I ask it to provide the necessary data in order to make those decisions so one of the most common problems that I see when I look at other people's prompts is they'll like input a website and they'll say something like okay write a perfect cold email for a VP of Finance at this website and it's like okay maybe it's going to be able to do that but what we always do is we pull all of the data down into a column inside of clay or whatever platform that you're using and then we're not saying hey this is the website use whatever you know about the website we're in control of it so we're saying this is the information that we know and we'll scrape the website using zenr or we'll take their LinkedIn company description or whatever it might be and we will feed the information to the prompt and then I will label all that information so I'll label the information with say the person's job title their job description and then what the company does and I'll label all of those things as a part of Step two and then step three is probably the uh the biggest thing that we do or the thing that I spend my most of my time on this is where we try to constrain the creativity of the prompt and so this constraining creativity term I think maybe Jordan Crawford told it to me first but him and I when we were doing a lot of research together when AI was new this is a lot of the things that we'd focus on I think of AI as a 12-year-old who has infinite knowledge and you really have to Corral that 12-year-old into the task that you're requesting for it to do right and so sometimes a big another problem I'll see people doing is they're not giving enough guidelines to the prompt and that's why their prompts go all over the place and so for example if you told a 12-year-old with infinite knowledge go sell tacos you think that you gave it enough Direction but that's not at all enough Direction what kind of tacos are they are they going to sell tacos from a taco stand are they going to have a restaurant are they Gourmet tacos are they truffle tacos are they street tacos are where do they sell the tacos what should they price the tacos there's so many problems do they give the tacos away for free so many questions come of the instruction that then that's where you get all of your deviations of your output now being correct so here we really set constraints and I and usually the way that I do this is I think through all of the things that I want it to do and I instruct it on all the things that I really want it to do as if I were to tell a human to do it and then usually what I'll do is I'll just test 10 outputs and then I'll kind of see what needs to get changed and then I'll edit it in this third part in here and so then the fourth part is I give examples of what a good output would be so then I'll say something like if this is a company description this would be a good output and Al I'll put that straight into the prompt the main thing you need to keep in mind there is sometimes AI will get its wires crossed and if you say this is a good example use this as an example the reference data you put in that example it might bleed through the to the output so a lot of times what I'll say is something along like uh keep in mind this is only an example for you to learn from it has nothing to do with the reference data above and should not be a part of your output at all but here's some information for you to learn from and then we give it the examples right there um and then final thing on this in particular is I also like to stay in control of our sentences and so I will normally set a prefix for our sentences because even if you were to tell a human how to write an email you're still going to say hey I found this research from this place and this is what I think of it so you know I checked out your website and saw how you help Fitness enthusiasts breathe better I checked out your website doesn't need to change every time so we'll set as a prefix and I'll tell tell AI every time you output something include this as a prefix so that I can I can make the email flow because I know I know what that sentence is going to be because it's just completing that sentence and then it can flow I I I don't want it to do crazy other things um from there as well too and so that's just my four-step framework uh in that regard and so like I said first you just want to tell it its overall goal so step one tell it its overall goal step two give it the data to reference from so it can make the decision and then step three constrain its creativity and really give it a ton more um of you know a like guide guidance of exactly what you want it to do as if you were to give a human a uh example of what to do and then offer examples as those good outputs give it prefixes and all those different kind of things my second biggest tip I would say for sure to help with this four-step framework work is to get some kind of voice to text dictation software on your uh computer because sometimes you won't I find myself not making my prompts as detailed as I need them to be because I feel like I can't type as fast as I need them to be and so sometimes I'll cut things out and I don't want to do them and I get frustrated because I just don't want to type them all out and so then having a voice to text dictation software uh really helps to bridge that Gap because then you can just talk into it because now with 40 mini it's so cheap that I don't really care about the amount of inputs or anything that I give it because my output size is going to be so tiny because we're not you know we're only writing just a cold email here uh well I maybe that's my other tip too and I'll get back to that we never write the whole cold email we only do pieces of it um with AI and so um using a voice to text dictation service really helps right now I found whisper flow to be really good it's only available for Mac so I'm sure if you have a Windows computer you can just check out anything else but whisper flow has been really really great for us so that's another thing to keep in mind I have talked about this a ton and I forget to tell people because I've talked about it so much but do not use AI to write your entire email unless you create your own AI like model which we'll probably talk about towards the end uh of my plan here um we specifically only use AI even if if we're going to AI generate all four sentences if we're using four sentences in a cold email uh even if we are going to AI generate all four of those sentences I use a different prompt for each one of those sentences because if you ask it to do too many things at once it starts going off the rails and so I would say that goes into just our other tip is uh whenever we're using AI again I don't ask it to even write two sentences at a time so we also don't ask it to do multiple things at once as well too and so a good example of that is we sometimes you're using AI to do research and then sometimes you're using AI to write something and so what I won't have ai do is I won't have ai do both the research and the writing in one prompt and so let's take an example let's say we're making a AI that is going to read a company job description figure out why they want to make this higher and then talk about how we can help play somebody for that role so a normal Staffing recruiting Outreach AI message so if you were to make one AI to write that message it's going to get a little crazy but if you make one AI to go in and say hey why do they want to be hiring for this role in particular what is the reason that they want to be hiring for what certifications are they looking for what qualifications are they looking for and summarize all of those things for me then you would be able to jump in and get it into a summary and then you would say okay now next AI using that that summary like output in this way and then we can just go into it as well and so it whenever we're using AI we always want to try to have ai do one thing at a time we don't want AI to take on too many things because it's really only good at doing one thing really well at a time and so I know I talk fast so if I were to just do a quick review we first talked about the four step framework that we use Define your objective give it the data to make the decision from constraint it creativity and then give it examples and then also only ask AI to do one thing at a time and sometimes you could split that up between gathering information and then actually executing your AI line but that's just you know just one example you have two other tools at your disposal that you can use to increase your uh you know the accuracy or of your prompts and what you want it to do you not only have The Prompt itself but then you have the system prompt and then you have the examples that can lead into it and so I'll take the system prompt first the system prompt I used to thought think that this was a waste of time and I wouldn't really ever edit the system prompt and to this day if we're doing something like super simple where it's just hey all I want to say is I was on your website and I saw that you help Fitness enthusiasts breathe better I don't use a system prompt for that it can handle that but if we're asking it to do anything more complicated we will at least add a little bit of a system prompt and so you can think of the system prompt as just the the role that you're giving the AI so that it kind of knows the job that it needs to do and so uh one other tip is never tell the system prompt or the AI that you're writing a cold email uh not because I think there's any kind of security problems that they'll stop you with uh mainly it's because then all of the garbage SEO information that it's been trained on for a cold email all the people who try to rank for cold email tips and things like that all the those garbage articles are going to Bubble Up we always say persuasive message never say help me write a cold email because it's just going to it's just going to go crazy and so in the system prompt sometimes I would say one of the things that we really do often across all of our customers because I guess another like mini tip here is I fully believe that most AI prompts for cold email you should be able to post them publicly and they're not going to help anybody except your for your competitors because you should be using your own prompts for for AI we do have a couple that we use a lot for other customers and so one of those is I love to train AI on what the company does and then we will show the AI what the prospects company does so that we can make the email really relatable to their offering and how they help people and all those kind of things we do that for a bunch of our customers so that's one that kind of breaks that rule we will edit the system prompt to say that they are a VP of sales a part of the team and this is what the company helps helps people do and you are just speaking casually but professionally at a conference to somebody and you are you know explaining how you would specifically be able to help their company don't use any words that are above a fifth grade reading level don't use any words like amazing or you know overly complement them or any of those things that's a good time for the system prompt because uh we really need to nail that relevance messaging and it changes you know it costs us no time and no money to add four sentences in that system prompt to really nail hey you are an officer of this company this is what the company does and often times when we find out when we want to quickly train that system prompt we will just open up chat gbt 40 in the user interface with internet access and then we'll literally just say hey go to this website and you know in eight sentences tell me what this company does and then we'll copy and paste that and put it into the the training just so that anybody on my team can do that without having knowledge of what they're trying to do so I guess another little tip there and so the system prompt overall we just use it when we need it to change its role and we need it to like when in situations where it's doing some really high level thinking or we can't have it sound like a bot that's one of the examples we use the system prompt for the examples and so if you're new to AI using the examples is like um basically you can when you're using the chat GPT interface you can have conversations with AI when you're using examples you can say say this is what the prompt is and then this is what I would want the output to be so that chat TBT can look back at the conversation and say ah yes okay they said this and then I was supposed to say whatever to that I'm G to keep following that pattern and so I would say we we dedicate far more time to the examples than we do the system prompt and so we'll get the whole prompt done get everything going get a good Baseline of just what we want it to say uh without changing anything and then before we let ai go crazy and we send all of those emails we'll write two to four examples manually to just make sure that it knows exactly what we're trying to achieve and so I would say examples is maybe the most expensive thing to add to your prompt but it is the most gamechanging when it comes to up like really increasing the quality of your prompt and getting the exact messaging and the phrasing and everything after or that to to Really increase you know the effectiveness of your prompt and so and even then with 40 mini it's not even that expensive unless you're like trying to Output books or something and so uh anyway then so that's how we basically think about using examples and using the system prompt when it comes to troubleshooting the AI one tip that I found that I like is I feel like and I did this when I first started prompting I feel as though a lot of times people will see something wrong with the prompt and then they'll say do not do this thing and then I what I found is I don't feel like that covers enough of the edge cases and so if I see something wrong with a prompt I'll put in hey don't do this thing but I'll also add more instructions so you're saying hey don't do this but I'll add instructions of do do this so if it keeps outputting in your if if you are if you don't follow my my advice and you are trying to Output an entire email and it keeps starting every email with I hope this email finds you well and you put in I I've literally done this before I've literally written four times in a row in different ways do not start this email with I hope this finds you well please whatever you do do not start this email with I hope this finds you well I hope this finds you well is a terrible way to start emails blah blah blah it'll still start it with that and so I will tell it in a different way and I'll say okay hey take on the Stu style of Josh Braun who you you could add that to the system prompt take on the style of Josh Braun John Barrow Sam McKenna um Jen Allen C so sorry is there an end in that name anyway um take on that style and write in this framework and do this and all these things then it it'll stop doing I hope this email founds finds you well right so whenever you are troubleshooting the AI and you're looking to change your prompt tell it what not to do but then also give it more deta detailed instructions especially in that third part of your prompt where you're constraining the creativity right another way that we increase the effectiveness of our prompts and and through troubleshooting is with examples that I talked about before I I would say most of the time we're changing our prompt and adding more examples very few times we're changing the system prompt so we're really playing a lot with the um the actual prompt and the examples but mainly what I'll do is I'll see something wrong I I'll tell it not to do it I still do that but then I'll give it more instructions around that thing to combat that thing of what to do instead because for some reason in the negative it doesn't work um as well and so then another tip that I have about AI prompting is sometimes you want AI to do research for you and find if something is true or not and or you're using something like cayen or an AI agent inside of clay or you're using any kind of AI agent and you're saying hey return this data for me A lot of times so I again I think that AI is kind of like a 12-year-old with infinite knowledge and as we all know if you've ever met a 12-year-old sometimes they just even if you tell them to be quiet they'll just still say something and so if you're building a workflow and it requires that if the data is not true you want the prompt to be empty so that it doesn't move on with the rest of your workflow it's not going to do that really well and the reason reason it won't do that really well is because then it'll still output something like oh I could not find the answer to this or it'll just start making things up and so what we'll start doing is again another tip is We'll add in confidence intervals and so one gez even while I'm going through this video there's more tips than I even wrote down so like so I'm actually even going to write down we're going to re visit the confidence interval thing because um and I'm just writing that down so let's say you're asking it to go find like to read a website and find case studies that the the website is you using Cent or you even downloaded all the text and you're asking about case studies if you say hey I need you to find this case study if it doesn't find a case study it might just make one up and that is going to be way way way worse than anything that else that could happen and so what we'll do is we'll say hey if you are not more than 90% sure that this is the case study from the website and it's a really positive case study you can't bring me back to information output the word purple and I asked it to Output the word purple so that I again stay in control of what the output is going to be and I can set the rest of my workflow to just not continue if it contains the keyword purple in this scenario and so this is really great when you are giving it a bunch of text that it needs to do research on but it's really really great when you're using clent a good example of this is i g I was trying to build a cagent to go out and find case study about a customer and so go to the website and go find case studies you know that this customer has listed on their their website and I I told it multiple times like we were talking about I told it do not get your information from any other source other than the website in the input all of your information must come from this website do not deviate anywhere else and to make sure that it was actually working I put in one of my favorite Brands noall project who sponsored the CrossFit Games at one point if you ever want to talk CrossFit I'm here uh and so I put in one of those websites it didn't go to Noble project.com it couldn't find case studies on Noble project.com so then it went and it searched the internet and it found the marketing agency that built Noble Project's website that they listed Noble project as a case study and it gave me that back and it's like no I don't want you to do that so that's why we always say like hey if you can't find this information within this confidence interval then just output this keyword so that I know you couldn't find it I don't ask it to say nothing because it's never going to say nothing it it's its whole job chat tbt's whole job is to chat it's literally just always going to talk back to you so we'll have a keyword that we can filter out on and so again double tapping more into confidence intervals another thing that I see people doing wrong with AI is they use AI to sometimes they're using AI to figure out if a company is a SAS company or not a SAS company and so what you're essentially doing there is you're saying hey AI I'm giving you a binary choice is this a SAS company or is this not a SAS company well then it doesn't really there's so much gray area between that one of our customers is pilot.com are they a SAS company I don't know because on their website they talk about all the amazing software that they can enable their customers with but they really are a tech enabled service they don't give anybody access to that SAS but they are a venture funded company and they've built a lot of their own technology is it a SAS company it's a little tough I would say no because you don't actually get access to the software but they talk a lot about how they build custom software for their customers and AI is going to get confused by that and so what we'll do is I'll say I don't say rate this company if it's SAS or not I will say on a scale of one to 10 one being not a SAS company and 10 being a SAS company or one to five it doesn't matter because you'll see why I come up with these numbers um rate on a scale of 1 to 10 whether or not it's a SAS company will'll use that instead so that I can manually review it and say okay anything above a seven is pretty safe if it's below a seven we're going to discount it whatever that might be and then the reason I like to have those numbers is because then I could give it examples and I could say hey a one is a construction company like it's nowhere near a SAS company right another kind of company that is not a SAS company is a you know uh gez I don't know a sports League or something or a gym or a a barber shop or all these These are ones they are not SAS companies whatsoever and then we could tell it you know a 10 would be Salesforce Salesforce is 100% a SAS company that's all they do very well-known SAS company here we go and then I will manually give it examples of okay so I would rate this one as a like I would rate pilot as a six because this and that's why I probably wouldn't use one to 10 for this SAS framework but I just wanted to tell you I probably would use one to four because then you can handle like barber shops where it's not even close and then you could handle like a marketing agency that uses software and then you could handle Tech enabled services at at three and then four could be the the SAS companies right and so then you set those parameters and that works way better than just asking for a binary so anyway that's just a little bit of what I wanted to say about uh confidence intervals then I would say there's three other tips that I would give about actually prompt thing and then we'll probably talk about Cent for a little bit and then uh wrap up the video and so again with just overall prompting tips another thing that we found that works really really well is at the end of your prompt to kind of guilt the AI and say please could you get this right I need you to take your time think through this do not rush take as much time as you need in order to get the right response you know blah and then it'll like and then I'll say you know my job is on the line if you don't do this correctly I'm going to be fired please think thoroughly about your response before you give it I don't know why it just improves the results I I I don't have anything other than like it just improves the results and I I don't exactly know why um and so you can guilt it a little bit but one the two things there is to guilt it that hey I my job is on the line here but then the other thing that I think is really important is to ask it to take as much time as it needs in order to get to get these things done then uh one other trick that I found is to tell the prompt that to pretend that if you're trying to do something really analytical and your prompt isn't working and it's it you really got to get this right another trick that we'll use is I call it the the three wise men trick they can be women whatever you want and so I'll basically say hey pretend you are a group of three wise men or three wise women and then I'll assign what each wise person is charge of doing and I'll say okay you're in charge of making sure that the output includes this you're in charge of the output including this and then you're a skeptical person who you don't think everything's going to work and you're going to tell us why and then the other two are going to edit things whatever you're going to do and I'll assign a job to each wise person and then I'll say Do not output anything until you all three have spoken to each other and you agree on the output of what you need of what we need to do here I found that that works really really well when you're trying to do something analytical and you're you just can just tell it to have a pretend conversation between the the three wise people and so I don't know that's just another tip and then uh tree of thought prompting is another thing that I think everybody should just look up uh we don't use it a whole lot because again we're just trying to write one sentence at a time it's not rocket science here but if you're trying to do something above that I would definitely just check that out uh and again a lot of these tips are for writing s single sentences I would say if you're going any further than this you would want to take a look at creating something in the UI that's really custom trained or creating your own AI a lot of the things that we're doing we're just spinning up really quickly though for our customers so we don't we don't go that crazy with um setting custom instructions and all those other kinds of things but um yeah and then finally just if you made it this far in the video I appreciate it I don't know who is going to be interested in watching a video that's 30 minutes long about AI prompting but I'm thankful that you're on this journey here as always comment that you made it this far because I really appreciate it if you do watch this whole video and so with Cent just another thing is I I would say with Cent the biggest problem that I see people making with Cay if you've never heard of clay or Cent before cayan inside of this platform called Clay is an AI connected to a Google search that can do a ton of things for you cayan um I I I would just tell everybody the tough part about Cent is that it does not have a way to edit the examples and so we go really heavy on finding as many examples as possible and our Cent prompts still are I mean I've never been able to get Cent ever since 40 mini came out I've never been able to get Cent to charge me more than like 0\. one or maybe 01 is maybe the most expensive I'll get it now but most of our prompts are are way way cheaper than that and the important thing is you have to spend more time in the four-step framework defining the goal referencing the data constraining the creativity and then giving examples you got to spend more time in the examples when you're using cagent and that's basically my big tip just because there's no other exam way to give it examples so it just has to know what it's looking for but ever since 40 mini came out gez you could go crazy with Cent and it like basically cost nothing so that's been really good but uh yeah as always thank you guys for watching the video it's almost been 30 minutes and I hope it made sense because even while I was recording it other ideas were popping into my head and um I know that I have a very low production level on this YouTube channel and so if you made it this far just let me know because I super appreciate it thanks guys\#\# Date Posted: 2024-05-01

\# Hypothesis on Message Market Fit for Outbound Sales

hey everyone today we're going to have again a little bit of a longer video as long as my dog doesn't wake up and I need to go down I have been thinking a lot about how you can use cold email to find message Market fit but to really turn it into a science and not just a craptacular attempt at finding your message Market fit and so first I'm going to walk through why I was intending to do this and then we'll talk through the methodology and and some of my thoughts behind it and things like that so this could be quite a long video so I've been running my cold email Agency for three years now and something that I have said to myself and I see many of my colleagues who also run cold email agencies do is they will say you know this was a bad offer it was never going to work for cold email I'm you know you know I I had nothing to do with this we did our best that's it and I've even said that too and so I think for some cases that's absolutely the truth there are some offers that are just bad for cold email and I won't get into it now maybe I'll make a whole other video about that but there are some offers that that we just won't touch um with cold email because we've just been down that road before and we don't want to do it but if we fail with a client I am uncertain if it was because the offer was bad or were we not trying everything that we could and so I was thinking about it how can we build a process that's repeatable so that we can continue to test things and find message Market fit repeatedly right and so I've created this document that I'm not sure if I'm going to put on the YouTube video maybe I will maybe I won't um because it's got some stuff in there that if you become a customer of growth engine X it's some stuff that we'll be doing for services for you um but otherwise it goes through the entire process and so let's jump into that document and I'm just going to go through it and just explain the process so this is the document going over our I called it offer validation but I think I'm calling it message Market fit process now as well and so basically we're running it in two to four phases and you can kind of understand why and so the first phase that and so it basically goes from a spectrum of and this is my hypothesis a spectrum of trying to go directly for a sales conversation because we have no matter what you see on LinkedIn of people saying you should always be adding Value First blah blah blah blah I get that I agree great offers though you don't need to do that you can literally just email somebody and say hey I can solve this problem for you do you need me to solve that problem and you can book meetings as long as you solve that problem and they believe you you could book meetings so so we want to move on a range from is this an offer that we can just book meetings from or do we need to learn more about the market and so the first phase is basically the closest template to a sales email that uh I thought we could do but on a very broad range the second phase we are asking for feedback but we're also asking if they would be interested in a sales conversation as well and there's different ways that we do that the third phase um we do some different things where we ask for more kinds of testing and varying levels of price and and all those things just to see you know if somebody won't take something on for free they're not going to take it on paid you know so by the third phase we just want to see if if they'll even takes you up on an offer even if it's free and you're just giving away the farm and then we go back to testing with look like customers now again this is for the people who become customers of growth engine X the reason why we are doing this is because we have a way to get you launched early and so we basically have 600 inboxes that are always warming up that you can take advantage of and we can rent out for you and um they've got great deliverability they've got generic domains and we run these first four phases if you are a company who does not want to work with growth enginex but you enjoy the content I would say that you should start with phase four so if you work with growth enginex our offer validation process is we do the value proposition testing with the template we're going to do feedback surveys and some skepticism we'll do this offer testing at varying levels of price and all these other things and then we'll do the look like if you're somebody who you just want to run this on your own start with the lookalike test and so now just watch this video but if you want to run this on your own start with the lookalike test and just keep that in the back of your mind when we we go through it so why do we need to be doing offer validation from the the first place so one here's a perfect example sometimes we will launch crazy campaigns on behalf of our customers that literally take me hours and my team to put together hours to put together and so we this is an example of an email highly highly personalized highly highly relevant AI all over the place you look at this email which email do you think got more responses this email which you can read on your own I'm not going to get into it I'll just say that this whole line is AI generated this is scraped data and this is a mathematic formula and all that stuff then we also have this email we're helping Brands uncover their Anonymous site visitors so they can do this could I show you how it works which one were one in this case email 21 which is crazy right that that's like so crazy that we had all this personalization and everything and so now what was the difference between email 1 and email 2 well really this has all the personalization in the data amazing but see here where we specifically say so that you can retarget Shoppers that abandon their cart and don't leave an email behind that is just one of the six things that this customer can do and this message resonated the best so even though email 21 when we went back and we redid email 2 and we redid email to with this amazing stuff up here and we used that message not only did it beat email one and email 2 it blew email 2 out of the water and so the whole reason for doing offer validation is before we start going crazy with building all these tables that are going to take us hours to build we need to make sure that the messaging that we're actually sending people is messaging that actually resonates with them and then we can move on and so in this part I even say um AI messaging is a multiplier right so if you're getting zero responses AI probably isn't going to help you get responses magically unless you're changing your value proposition or something different resonates with the audience but if you are getting responses AI when you use it well can increase your responses and so then that's what we're we're basically seeing and so when we're creating this message Market fit anal proc for our customers uh one the templates that we work on work off of a spectrum from booking a direct sales uh call all the way to basically getting feedback it's the same thing for the way that we create offers and we think about value propositions for the outbound channel so the first thing and I get this from the client Ascension guys um they really open my mind to this but I just use it all the time now so credit to them um and we're just going to talk about it so the first thing that we think about when we're creating messaging for the out channel is we want to think about demand capture offers versus demand generation offers and so I'm not going to get too deep into this but basically are you capturing Demand with the customers that you intend to get or do you need to generate demand and so a lot the simplest way to break down demand capture versus demand generation is how known is the solution that you are pitching and how commoditized did it right is it so for example I know that I can get my website redone by somebody on Fiverr I can just post on Twitter and get somebody like there are a lot of people who can redo my website I know that that is something that I can get how many people know that it's possible to De anonymize site visitors even if they didn't leave their email address and then you can load them into an outbound campaign and then email them how many people know about that not that many so on one hand you have a lot of people who you know about the website and when there's not a whole lot that you can do to email people and say hey do you need your website done if they don't want their website redone there's not a whole lot that you could do and on the demand generation side usually you present your offer and they did not know about it and the biggest thing that you need to do is you need to make them believe you that it's actually possible because usually a lot of times they didn't they didn't know about it so inherently cold email is a demand generation channel right so that's why like website design cyber security I personally don't do Staffing and recruiting but I know other people who do Staffing and recruiting that's more on the demand capture side where like you had to wake up one day and be like yeah we need to redo our website while on demand generation I could email you and be like hey what if I were to turn the last 10 posts and all the people who liked that post what if I turned all the people who lik that post into email addresses and give it to you for free would you want that like they don't know that that's possible and I'm just returning it to them right so demand generation so we always want to take the offer of our customer and slant it towards demand generation even if it's a demand capture offer right so even if we're selling bookkeeping services bookkeeping services are inherently demand capture like you know that bookkeeping is possible but how do we turn that into a demand generation offer so one we could pitch it as an audit and basically say hey I know you have a bookkeeper now have you ever thought about are they helping you save as much money on taxes as possible or have you just ever wanted somebody to just check their work you've never even thought about having somebody check their work or maybe you have and you didn't know how to go to we can generate Demand on that another way that you can slant demand capture offers into demand generation officers is with your list as well and so this isn't an exhaustive list of all these things but I'm just giving you examples so again with bookkeeping it would be demand capture if you were just reaching out to a list blanket right but if you were reaching out to a list of companies that were founded in the last two years then your list is going to get a little bit better and they need bookkeeping services a little bit more and then if you were to take it a step further and say okay I'm going to reach out to companies that were founded in the last two years and they've received funding so I know that their bookkeeping needs to be Rock Solid then again we're going to you know move it more towards demand generation and then if I finally say I need them to be found in the last two years they're funded and the CEO has never been a CEO before and they've never founded a company before awesome so now you have a very high level of like demand generation where you could say Hey you know congrats and started the company I saw that in your LinkedIn experience it's the first company You' founded boom boom boom right and so you can slant demand uh demand capture offer into a demand generation offer either by the list that you create or and it's so funny now I already forget what I was talking about because I think about this all the time but anyway you can rewind for that kind of review but so anyway we always want to slant towards demand generation uh so that's the the first thing that we want to think about then the second thing oh yes so now the second thing that you want to be thinking about is that every offer has multiple value propositions that create that offer so my tagline when we speak with people is I say we can help you send the same email that you would send if you were to research a prospect for 10 minutes but we can send it to your entire Market that's my tagline now if I were to test what people care about on outbound channels I could say that but is that really what people are going to care about on outbound more than anything else I don't know but here are all the other things that we help with we help with email deliverability we can score accounts for whatever data you want about those accounts we can enrich them with whatever you want we could build those lists we could disqualify accounts that you think are good we do contact list building we can do contact enrichment contact scoring copyrighting campaign strategy insights for sending 1.5 cold 1.5 million cold emails per month AI messaging CRM Integrations we can even do like when somebody signs up for an inbound form and you want to send them an AI generated email like we we do that kind of stuff too and so right like there's so many different ways that we could break down that offer and we can find the thing that when we go outbound to people we can find the thing that is most interesting to those people on outbound because a lot of times when people come inbound that's not the same thing that they're going to care about when you go outbound so first we want to think about all the ways that we help people in ways that would be really sexy and get their attention and they would say oh you know I didn't know that that was possible awesome I would really appreciate that now I remember it when I was talking about demand generation versus demand capture you basically make them an offer like I said before um of do you want to just audit what your other you know accountant is doing and that kind of stuff right so you can break it down and then you can slant it way and so you basically think okay what are my what are the things that we do that people don't even really know that's possible and how can we slant towards that and then how could we break it up and test all these different things to see what people care about for instance one time I ran an email campaign basically telling saying to people hey I saw that Johnny is an SDR on your team so I figured you're running outbound emails I just wanted to point out to you you guys don't have Demar on your website and that's really necessary for emails to not land at spam could I just send you a video of how to fix this it takes two seconds I don't need to hop on a call with you I just noticed it on your website nobody cared it was so funny like nobody cared verses if I were to do a account scoring and account enrichment and like a contact scoring and contact enrichment I could get leads all day doing that like people really really care about doing something like that copyrighting people don't really care about um campaign strategy they kind of care about but it depends on the way that you pitch it um yeah and so anyway like it it just you have have to test all these things and this is this is why I've created this process because it's there's no mathematical way to go through this so like this I'm trying to put this mathematical way and then I'm going to show you a hypothesis on how you could test all of this too and so then we need to break down our um value proposition this is just another way actually this is just another way to just be thinking about what you do um basically I have this thing where basically every offer in the entire world comes down to helping people save time save money make more money live healthier or raise their status that's it in B2B you could basically cross these out because I've not really seen people you one you're just not going to talk to people about being healthier and then raising their status I've never really seen somebody convert an email and be like Oh I'm gonna help you get a promotion like that I've just never really seen that work we help PE in B2B we help people make more money we help them save money or we help them save time that's what it comes down to and a lot of times we do all three but just in different ways right and so that's just another framework that you could be thinking about like how like six ways I help people save time seven ways I help people make more money right just be thinking about that and so then we want to rewrite everything as offers problems and Lead magnets and so basically it's like an offer and I'm going to run through this a little bit quickly because this isn't as important but basically an offer is we help audience achieve outcome in time without risk reversal right so and I'm just GNA add this because we're right here we help audience achieve outcome in time without risk reversal this is classic if you follow Alex rosi classic thing I like I take no credit for this I just basically got this for him we help teachers lose 10 pounds in under 30 days or your money back there you go it it's very very to the point and so this is one way that you can be framing your value propositions we like for Tapo right we help people automate and brainstorm LinkedIn content in less than 10 minutes a day so you could fill your pipeline and you can cancel anytime whatever that might be for and and it's under $50 a month like whatever it is right and so or like Tapo could even give people the offer of like we give you the power of a ghost riter for 10 minutes a day for $50 a month just like it's just a no-brain like just ways that you could put it so first we want to think about it as an offer then the second way want to think about it is just problems and so it's basically like do basically we want it to use value propositions and basically in order to start a conversation with people say okay hey you know we help people with this are you guys seeing this problem right now or don't even say we help people with this literally say like do you have a problem hiring right now and then just start the conversation based on that so all the different problems that you solve you could just check and see if they have those problems and then lead magnets which this is the hardest one for people to crack back in B2B but this is like if you can't think of a lead magnet and and I am the next thing that I'm trying to hypothesize about and I've got a big road trip coming up and so maybe I can think about it then is how can anyone create a lead magnet because a lot of my B2B customers understandably so it's very difficult for them to create a lead magnet I'm sitting in a pretty awesome position as a Services Company because I could just perform services for free you know like that it's it's not the the end of the world for us to do something like that but for some of our customers like they only get value they can only provide value to their customers after they integrate their CRM you integrate your Erp you integrate your accounting system and then you integrate your slack or something like that and and you have to be so bought in by that point and so how are they supposed to be providing value for people so the next thing I'm trying to think about is is how everyone can be providing value and I think a lot of it comes down to just insights like you have earned insights about your Market that they don't have that's the whole reason you started the company or the founder started the company right and so that can become a lead magnet but anyway I kind of digress that's my next uh thing that I'm going to be thinking about and so um lead magnets again is like how can you solve a micro problem for somebody upfront without them paying you in order to build Goodwill and to start a conversation and to Garner their interest right so lead magnets is the best everyone should be thinking about how they could be doing like adding value for people um and the best lead magnets as you know Alex hosi says is that it's a free offer you can make to potential customers that your competitors are charging money for so we offer 5,000 contacts with validated emails and mobile numbers to potential customers because I know that they're not getting 5,000 contacts from anybody else I just know it for a fact that's just not happening and so then we we get into you know the next part of this where we're going to test our hypothesis so we have four phases that we test these hypothesis with or hypothesi hypothesis hypotheses I don't know and so the reason why we use templated messaging is because we want to work completely on the value proposition and nothing else and so in Phase One this template and I'm going to probably make it's own video about this template so if you saw this in another video it's the exact same template this is probably the best sales email template that I can think of as of April 2024 I'm like I I might come up with something else I might hate this two months from now who even knows but the reason I love this one so much is because it modulates for whatever offer that you have and so let's break this one down so the reason why we start with this again we want to start with trying to get sales conversations as quickly as we possibly can and if those sales conversations do not turn out to getting us the if this phase does not get a sales conversations then we're going to go from okay let's try to get sales conversations and then move the needle on the Spectrum to learning and getting feedback so that we can use that feedback in order to build better campaigns so let's break this one down so hey first name recency Waterfall by the way subject line here I I'm loving the subject line lately Rando from LinkedIn I don't know that's just personally what I'm liking recently hey first name uh by the way with subject lines really quick because everyone asks me about this our hypothesis for subject lines is you want to send a subject line that it's possible that a colleague sent them that email or a customer sent them that email without lying that is the overarching hypothesis with subject lines and that subject line needs to beat quick question or question for first name or like when you do like company custom company name and then like well here let me just put it like if you do this if your subject line isn't getting an open rate better then these subject lines just give up and just go with these subject lines I know everybody on LinkedIn is like I hate quick question but so like that yeah I know but if you're not beating that these are the go-tos of of subject lines right anyway uh so hey first name recency waterfall so let me explain the recency waterfall a lot of lot of people look at personalization and AI generated content as a binary between personalization and relevant and so by personalization it's basically like hey I saw you spoke at that event three years ago amazing like you're such a good great speaker buy my thing or I saw you went to Wharton College go Pennsylvania buy my thing it just all it's just a checkbox it it doesn't really do a great job of opening up the sales conversation of course relevance is better and if you can do relevance you want to do relevance that's the thing that you want to do 100% completely agree I know for the purposes of this template when we are working with a customer and they have an obvious relevance that they should be using for instance one customer that we're talking with right now they sell into companies that have an Enterprise sales motion so we're going to change this to hey VP of sales I saw Brian on your team it has is selling in Enterprise and so I thought it would be good to reach out whatever um but without that barring those very obvious relevant ones uh we use recency and so what do I mean by recency so recency is still personalization but the reason I like it better than just be Bow's personalization is at least it makes sense to the person of why I'm reaching out to them right now and it's because they recently joined the company a new leader has recently joined the company they posted recently on LinkedIn there's company news that we found their CEO is on a podcast or oh Jee or uh company news the company LinkedIn has recently posted all all these different things right and so specifically I think oh never mind so recency waterfall so we have all these things if if we can't find anything recent about the the company then we will just fall back to basically hey first name not sure if you handle this or employee one uh or employee two is better to reach out but I saw that your company helps Fitness enthusiasts smell better and I thought we should reach out right and so then that's how we segue from the recency into the messaging to be tested we basically do the recency I saw your LinkedIn post about you know offers and value propositions then I dug a little bit deeper and saw how your company is helping Fitness enthusiasts breathe better and I thought we should connect then that's where we put the messaging to be tested so one we're getting this check mark of of good personalization of okay this makes sense this is something recent that's happened I agree or we're saying hey I'm not sure if I should be reaching out to you or Mary what's the deal here and then we move on and we basically say I saw your company does this and and I thought we should connect now here's where we insert this so then all of those different offers that you came up with we insert that here and this is where we go trial by fire do people care about your offer do they care about what you do so we like I said check mark whether they believe that a human sent this or they just want some effort being put into the email but that's all we're trying to achieve right here then your value composition to the fire do they care about this then we use AI to basically teach AI what does your company do and then we say we give an input of what the prospect company does and then we train it with three five seven examples whatever we need to make it look good where we say okay if we're reaching out to a company that does this I want to say this if we're reaching out to a company that does this I would say this so if we're reaching out to Jim shark with a bookkeeping offer we'd say specifically I think it could help you as you're selling to Fitness enthusiasts to keep your books in line so that you can keep promoting and uh keep getting attention instead of worrying about your books whatever that might be right just quick example just so that again we can just drive home and help them imagine what does this offer look like in my company to me and then we say if we could help you and then just a quick recap of this messaging to be tested if we could help you with your bookkeeping would that be useful to you boom boom boom and then PS and then we do a custom AI generated call out so our fallback again here is again let me know if I should be reaching out to employee one or employee 2 uh if they would be a better contact for this or we'll do something cheekier than that like I've made an AI generation where we look at when they attended college and then we look for positive news that happened at the college during those years and then be like oh I saw you attended Wharton business school or Ruckers business school between 2018 and 2022 how crazy was it when they won the championship Ruckers does win championships but you know what I mean another thing that we'll do is like um if they have any recommenders on their profile we can call out their recommenders and we could say you know hey saw the thing that John left really nice or we might even just count up how many times the keyword in their current type tit exists in their past then count up how many years they've done that and then say oh looks like you've had marketing titles for 15 years what what's been the biggest change you know since you started just something again so that we have this like personalization sandwich so anyway I spent a lot of time explaining this one because I really think that if you're trying to start cold emailing and you want to do this by yourself this is probably the best template that I have thought of as of this point and maybe there's people who think that they have better templates that's great as of this point this is the most modular template that I can say across everyone I I believe that this is the the most helpful because it modulates for whatever you need to test personalization sandwich here message need to be tested this Ai modulates and then this tests you know it just modulates for anyone otherwise I really hate templates because it just doesn't make sense then this is an explanation of all that stuff then we'll move to phase two so what we basically say is you know now we're still still going to try to generate leads but we want to just strip everything back and we're possibly looking for feedback so one we'll send from our own inboxes and we'll say we have a potential client that boom they told me you'd find it interesting but I wasn't too sure if they could help you insert offer would that be useful I know you're not being put in a sequence blah blah blah blah blah so basically all we're doing with this is we are I hate to say like just basically doing a pattern interrupt where basically like no no marketer in the world would ever say hey I'm not sure if this is a good offer do you think it's a good offer like there's every marketer just comes with confidence and they just come in swinging and so here we're just trying to interrupt that pattern a little bit by one stripping out the AI and just letting this ride on its own but then also just being like you could totally tell me that this sucks by the way like just you know be honest with me um and so then we just take it from there then we have our market research um one as well all this really is is just really a super short campaign again I just want to strip away I don't want anybody thinking the AI messed up anything here we're just breaking down the the offer and we're just stripping it all back so we'll do a poke the bear question so basically be like uh Josh Brun has really great content on this you should really check him out for these kind of questions but we'll basically say something like how are you automating the commission payments for your s strs and AES and accounting for all the variables in their pay or is that an easy process for you however you want to frame that question if if someone could help you know automate all of your commission payments would that be useful would that save you time what like what would that be boom boom and so here we go and um then so basically in these phases we strip out all of the AI and we are now even more putting your value proposition to the fire and we're a little bit more asking people for feedback and so if they say yes this would be useful this is still a lead but we're also saying like hey it's totally fine to say no and that we're crazy on this one and so um this investory template I almost don't want to show people because you guys are going to like go crazy about it I think I'm so sorry I might skip it I'm not gonna give you the okay here's the thing I'm not going to give you the exact phrasing I so if you're watching this and you potentially want to become a growth engine X customer I appreciate that I'm so sorry the so for all the cold email agencies who are watching this the only reason I'm not sharing it with you is because if you steal our actual wording then it's just going to get crazy it's this whole thing's not going to work basically we have set up a website and a domain and fake LinkedIn profiles and everything that we basically look like a venture capital fund and we basically are asking people we're like hey we want to make this investment but we're not sure do you even need something like this and that's the whole premise of the campaign if you want to find out more about that and you are interested in growth Engine exess Services I'll show you the whole template so then we have the uh media template down here and so basically so this is something that I'm working on that I believe this could become a lead magnet for every customer as well so if you don't have a lead magnet this is something that we could possibly do and so with this media template what we're doing is we're going to pretend to be a media company and uh we'll say we basically make the subject line request for quote from first name and then we say we're speaking with other sales leaders and we're curious if you could get if we could get a quote no call is necessary we just said two questions question intended to actually ask their opinion so with this our whole intention is what insights do we actually want to gain from the market that we genuinely don't know right now and we're actually asking for their opinion we don't need it to be two paragraphs like just a quick two sent something that they can answer in two sentence and then number two question intended to see if they have the problem we might be able to solve then we're asking them a question to basically say oh H interesting by the way um you know whatever you answer here then we'll also say like oh you know do you like do you have a plan for this or do you struggle with this or blah blah BL like whatever it might be and then that could possibly turn into a lead but we're more like asking for feedback to see if people even care about this just to get them talking right and so um this could look like hey do you on your list of priorities in like how are you currently handling your book actually with with this one it would be like hey I saw you're an ear estate startup company how are you managing your bookkeeping at this stage in your business you know do you Outsource it or is it inter etal whatever it might be actually that's like so much more of a question I don't know and then it would be like these it's so subjective and I'm trying to think about them on the Fly maybe I should have been a little bit more prepared for this one but so then we basically say Okay um you know are there any issues that you found from Outsourcing your accounting or something I don't know think on this on your own and and think about the questions I'm kind of failing at this point I've worked all day uh I did a crossfit workout it's been a little crazy so anyway then we we keep it going so then we have this Media Company where we're just all we're trying to do is just get them to respond and just give us advice same thing with the investor template all we're trying to do is just get them to respond and give us advice then phase four so again if you want to run this by yourself and you have your own domains run phase four as phase one because I personally think it's the best thing that you could possibly do it's just so much more custom and it's to your you know brand and everything so the the first thing that we'll do with somebody's domains their their custom domains after they warmed up for three weeks is we run a lookalike campaign and a similarity between senders campaign and so look like is easy we use ocean. to basically take their best case study customers and then we whatever outcome they cause for those case studies we basically go to other companies that fit that case study and then we say hey we already achieved this for you know a company similar to you this is exactly what it looked like would you want to chat more about that and then um the similarity between senders one this I actually got from somebody on LinkedIn and um I I'll if this person reminds me and they watch this video I'll put their LinkedIn profile in the description so you guys can follow him um he totally said told me about this and I really want to give him credit and now I kind of just forget oh look somebody's looking at this funny and now I just forget that uh who sent it and um I really really apologize so if they reach out I'll just tell you um that it was them and so the similarity between senders is like if we found that like the sender that we have they went to the same school they used to work at the same large company they have the same investors like anything that we can find similar to just bridge the gap I I've even run this before with people who have the same names and um that's even worked too so your list is not going to be huge on either of these but at least it just gets the ball rolling and it just you could start just pushing things and and um seeing what messaging people care about and you can start generating leads both on the look likee side and then the similarity between senders and so then if you're also watching this and you want to do this yourself I didn't speak at all about follow-up emails or anything like that and so the way we think about follow-up emails is I really like to add some kind of meme if I can to the follow-up email and so I'm not sure how Loom is sharing this but I'll try to make a a meme really quickly so one meme that I really like like to use is and so one the reason I like a meme is because it helps get the point across but it also cuts through the noise and so I know people are going to be like what you can't send images and cold email yeah if it's a followup and your inboxes have been warming as long as ours have it's fine and so um there's this meme of the suas canal that I'll show you and so basically will a lot of times no matter what everyone's offer kind of helps people save times so um here two seconds I know this isn't great for YouTube I know I'm coming so sorry so this is like one that we'll create all the time is I'll just like insert this Meme and it so it's just problem you need solve so your bookkeeping updating the CRM you know reaching out to leads whatever whatever problem you you solve will just label that here in as short as a time as we can and then we just put your teams bandwidth and like we booked a meeting with mongod DB and other huge companies uh with this one so yeah I just so this meme is really good and then honestly just like any meme that kind of just makes sense for the way you help companies I like sending that and then another thing that I like to do too is I'll still AI generate the next line and I like to make like a company analogy line so I'll just basically be like oh the same way that your company helps people optimize their workflows we help people optimize their outbound and then blah blah we get into it so we'll like launch with that campaign that company analogy and then send a meme like that and um just double tap them on a lot of these campaigns some of them we we only send the first email but some of them will also double tap and do things like that too and so in conclusion again one if you want to become a customer growth engine X this is our new onboarding process there's a link below to our wait list I would be happy to chat with you two this is just a hypothesis that I just want to put out into the world that I think we can apply the scientific method better to finding message Market fit especially on the cold outbound Channel and this is currently my hypothesis on it and so if you just run through it one more time you want to find a spectrum between demand generation and demand capture and then you basically want to list out all your value propositions and how you help people break it down into how you help people save time save money and make more money most offers are going to fall into those and then we have these templates that you can run through so there's just goto and so then you can test your messaging you just put your messaging to the fire and really quickly get those messages out instead of worrying about what your whole email looks like and making sure that you have like a coherent email um strategy every time just these templates just make it a lot easier to just roll through that and so I hope this was useful uh last time I made a video this long I really really appreciated how many people wanted me to make another video this long and so uh if you could reach out and say lion fish or something like that that'd be cool so that I knew that you watched the whole video so yeah reach out on LinkedIn that if you want to work with us there's a weight list sign up um Below in the description and I hope you have a great day thanks so much for making it to the end of the video\#\# Date

\# Josh Braun Copywriting Review

so if you're watching this video as just a standalone video this video is being done as a part of my course and so at the beginning of my course I said I I am not a cold email copywriting expert and and I don't pretend to be um what we really specialize in and I hope you've seen other videos to to see this is what we specialize in is data and how we could segment your Market by using better data data which makes your messaging better and and all those things the person that I get a lot of cre content from and a lot of uh advice from on cold email is Josh Braun and so we're on Josh Braun's website right now and the reason I want to bring this up is because one if you're doing cold email you should just be following Josh Bron he's got like 200,000 followers he's really great at this stuff and he in particular talks a lot about cold email copyrighting and so what I wanted to do was basically go through his blog and you could see we have all these tabs up here and I just want to talk through the lessons that he has taught in no ways am I trying to say that this is my information it is not my information it is Josh bronze and I am just reacting to it and I am telling everybody here that maybe you should even stop this video and you should go to Josh Bron's content because it is so good um we're just going to quickly like run through this and if we take 20 minutes to kind of just react to everything that's the intention of this video and so he has this blog before and after cold emails and so uh basically all this is just about like how you can show people what it like it would look like if they were to implement your product and what the before and after would be so in the example he uses an example with phone ready leads phone ready leads is a company that they basically are dialing all the phones to tell you who connects and who doesn't and so uh you would go from a message where you're basically like hey do you want like phone ready leads like we could do it but what Josh is saying here is hey John looks like your SDR is a cold calling directors of benefits we could generate this with AI super super easily so we would just first know that they have sdrs and then we would um use AI to figure out what title they're usually selling to what are you doing to increase your connect rate I love this sign like this line Josh Brun calls this poking the bear and maybe this will come up in one of his blogs um but it's basically like getting them to think about you know what are you doing in order to to help with this stuff 1,00 plus sdrs are having 8 to 12 conversations and schedule one to two meetings for every 50 outbound dials no new tech this great social proof line so this is the amount of sdrs who are taking advantage of this they're having 8 to 12 conversations and schedule one to meet two one to two meetings for every outbound dials like one great social proof but then two these numbers are amazing as well for people who run outbound dialing teams no new tech again this is showing them like you don't have to implement like a whole new software to get all this done we tune up your call script and identify which benefit directors are most likely to pick up the phone want to run a free test awesome awesome offer here to offer it for free but then he's sending this image to show what the before looks like with most people's data so their you know connect rate is two three two out of 50 I would assume I assume this is 10 this is two out of 50 and then the connect rate over here is like you know a third and then they're already booking meetings as well and so yeah just one I I just really love this email got a great poke the bear going great social proof and then a freaking great offer of running a free test you know Josh Brun is the goat for for a reason let's move on to the next one Henry's cold email Pop Quiz why did I respond to Henry's cold email okay so here's the email and so I'm not going to I wish we could we could put this down hey Josh subscribe to your email list a few weeks ago I've been doing digital marketing for eight years have a few unconventional ideas might that might Goose sales of your badass I guess grow sales of your badass guide without offering discounts okay so obviously this really fits into now you wouldn't be able to automate this but this really fits into um that IDE a of like if you were to manually reach out to somebody what's the human thing that you would say this is a very human email I have no thought that they've automated this but it would be tough to kind of automate this um well except for saying subscribe to your email list a few days ago a few weeks ago we'd be able to automate this part because we could use AI to find out their badass guide uh like what products that they sell uh but anyway I don't get paid unless you make more worth batting around a few ideas Henry not sure if it's it fit for you but several course creators I'm working with are seeing 10 to 12% month-over-month boost in sales okay I without this with just seeing this I was even going to say I don't see any social proof but love how in the PS line they put the social proof so again Josh Brun subscribed personalization great don't get paid unless you makes more um Josh Bron calls this the zone of resistance so like you're you instead of being like oh they're going to charge me $110,000 for this you know don't get paid unless you make more that's amazing not sure if it's a fit also Lo lowers the zone of resistance uh so Josh Brun when he talks about this again you want to talk like a human like by just throwing out to people and saying like oh you know we can do all of this for you and it's great and you know there's nothing wrong with our product and we guarantee an Roi and all this stuff people like that just sounds like a salesperson and so it sounds way more human to just be like oh hey like not sure if there's something here but we'll see like I said impact in Social proof a few unconventional ideas Peaks curiosity what I so i' like this too but what I don't like about this is if I were to email some and say hey I've got some unconventional ideas for you my first thought is if you had unconventional ideas why don't you just send them to me so what I like to do sometimes is I'll say like I had some unconventional ideas for you if I made a loom video going over those ideas would you take the time to watch it so that then I'm like asking to make sure that my time is going to be worth it um that's the way I think about it it just because like I said I don't like it when people say I had a few unconventional ideas for you because then it's like if you had ideas why don't you just send me the ideas um of course uh this is not a hidden run we're in this together love that casual WR oh yeah casual writing is probably the biggest thing here so again obviously it's a Josh bronze blog my two senten is just on this part but again Josh BR Nails it with this one be cheeky let's look at this being cheeky isn't appropriate because I sell to cite um let me move this in too um oh my video was blocking being cheky is inappropriate humor is inappropriate for medical professionals my take the sea suite and medical professionals are people they all like it John you don't have to wait here are a few colds you don't have to wait three days to reply how long have you gone so long without responding to me I'm a delight waiting your fair but Stern reply this one I like so these other ones I don't here I'm GNA just give my take on this Josh Brown is obviously the goat but awaiting your profanity filled response that one's kind of funny uh see I agree with this if you could make somebody smile you will increase your response rat so I totally agree with this the only so I guess what I kind of don't like about these emails is um I I'm I'm a Believer in Orin cla's style of never be needy and like you as a salesperson are here and then they're up here like your your status is not aligned and what we need to be doing is aligning our status as much as we possibly can in order to be on the same playing field as them and so um how have you gone so long without responding to me I'm a delight that that's kind of something that like somebody desperate would say like a c like the CEO of Ford would never say that to the CEO of like Amazon so um yeah I like awaiting your fair but Stern reply I like this one a lot and actually I think I'm gonna start implementing this one um awaiting your profanity field response I think this might make them laugh as well um so as follow-ups yeah I kind of like these but so in my opinion when you're following up with people the biggest trap that people get into is they're not trying to close that status alignment you're like just exuding desperation and uh so yeah that's my only thing here on on these follow-up emails one thing that kills cold email response rates we help revops claim the power of incentives with a platform built for Revenue focused teams oh formal writing okay cause cold email if other cold emails are written like that this must be the way it's done the Cure say it casually yeah I would definitely agree with this I came across your work through no I came across your name through our work with Pete bizops at gong he cut down commission inquiries by giving reps visibility into how calculations were made says you have 100 plus reps too thought you might be interested did you see the video of bizops team getting pay account what do you think have great yes we could take great see yeah again like yeah um so with all of these again I love super super short emails because you know when you get to the point and like it's got social proof it explains why you're reaching out you know like people it it's so easy to say yes to this and so with these super casual emails I really like these to be honest in my agency I've like suggested these to customers and and they don't like it um personally I love these emails and and like another one that I'll add on that he didn't state in here is something like um actually like Jed Marley showed this one to me so it'd be like hey Jed uh shortest email you're going to get all day um have you been thinking about how to cut down commission inquiries by giving reps visibility into how calculations were made boom um and then maybe put in the PS line saying something like you have 100 plus reps oh like we're helping Pete at gong saw you have 100 plus reps too thought you might be interested and so it' be a super super short email signature and then a PS line to show your social proof so it's like a 40w email alt together and so uh yeah of course formal writing is definitely going to kill things you definitely want to keep it casual again it's always thinking about one how do we make this person worth this person's time and two how do we say it like a human would say it and we don't put our our marketer hat on um okay so let's write a good cold email we need a person what's the job to be done who's currently doing it which results in all right so this is a good framework okay so let's take a back step back so basically he's saying okay first we need a customer so who are we targeting what like what problem are we trying to solve right they need to trim their Hedges what are they currently doing to trim their Hedges they're using pair of garden cheers and snapping off tree branches that hang over the fence what's the problem with their current solution uh what are their other Solutions what are the problems with those okay our solution okay great and so basically this is a good framework that anybody could kind of fit into and actually I'm going to think about maybe using AI with with this as well where now we have this framework of of okay like now we know all of these things about our message what's going to be the result okay hey Josh honestly now did you spend your youth dreaming about someday spending your Sunday afternoon trimming trees on Marbell Drive okay so this is like their other Solutions here right like what or like what they're currently doing and what's the result of that so basically saying like you're spending your time on this you shouldn't spend your time on this 10 million homeowners use cordless minisoft for to trim five trees in 30 minutes 6.5 hour charge no $100 per tree landscaper worth a peak so obviously this is like a b Toc play not something that we would normally actually send but this looks really interesting because it combines everything into a super super short message where this this what I like about this line and something that we don't talk about enough is um this is really honing into the emotions of the person so you're basically telling them like hey when you dreamt about buying a house did you think about all the Sunday afternoons you'd have to spend trimming trees of course not so you're like leaning into what they thought buying a house would be and you know I guess they're like childhood and their emotions and things like that and then we're getting straight into the social proof awesome and straight into the social proof and then we're also doing the without thing and so um oftentimes they get pitched where it's like you know oh we're a landscaper and we can take care of your Hedges and so then you're like pushing that solution away to be like you know those landscapers they're going to charge $ per tree that's crazy so now you can just pay what is this $79 and then you could cut five trees in 30 minutes so then we're like diving into that and so again I just another great example of a great email here we go hey Josh sorry to barge in have you considered repurposing your videos for Tik Tok so you can expand your reach Beyond LinkedIn great poke the bear question Alex rosi used our service to grow from Z to 45,000 followers in three months without lifting a finger amazing give no no worries if you're too busy to reply I know life as Sol preneur and tri athlete can get pretty hectic given an out no I'm not too busy to reply feels human love your snakes okay great and so again I actually think this is one of the best Frameworks that we're going to go over with Josh's stuff because um this is so relevant to so many other people so calling out negatives diffuses negatives um Josh Brun is a huge follower of um oh my gosh the guy who wrote the book that FBI Chris now you all on YouTube are going to make fun of me yeah the negotiations expert the X FBI guy Chris something I'm so sorry hey Josh sorry to barge in awesome have you considered repurposing your videos all right so that poke the bear question there's so many ways that we could use this right like you could use this poke the bear question then we've got a great social proof sentence here and then you know a nice so I guess this is interesting because the call to action is actually up here where we're saying like have you considered doing this social proof and then just kind of saying like there's no CTA here of like you know want to have a call or anything so that's one thing that usually we have a CTA in our emails but the CTA is up here and he kind of flipped it on its head so again just reacting here obviously I think that this is a pretty good email because I like Josh bronze stuff um but yeah let's move on to the next one all right so this is an email that landed oh it seems like we'd have to watch the video we have a lot of these to get through so we're going to keep going biggest cold email mistake let's see it sounds like what they already have in place okay so this is really true out they're making they're getting from A to B without you that's true so they already have a way of solving this Josh have you considered using a service to amplify your videos on Tik Tok so you can reach Beyond LinkedIn several creators use my service to grow their followers from 0 to 3,000 a few months without lifting a finger worth exploring either way keep up the killer content I enjoyed your two cents on viewing objections as something to understand rather than overcome oh reach Beyond LinkedIn okay yeah so um what I guess his A to B is like he already creates content on LinkedIn he doesn't need anybody to help him create content on LinkedIn that's his jobs to be done but he isn't on Tik Tok so now he would help somebody go from A to B on Tik Tok and he wouldn't have to lift a finger because he's already producing the LinkedIn content yeah so this one's definitely another good one this seems like it would be a video okay this is a good one to go over as well write cold emails with an eraser so this is the beginning and this is what he turns it into and so let's talk about how he went from you know A to B hi Josh these days your first page of Google is essentially your business card a simple Google search can affect how your business is viewed in the public eye information spreads quickly and the front page of research results might be full of links and stories that damage your reputation many potential clients do their research before making a decision and a single negative review can determine whether or not the client walks through your doors ar.com combines content removal reputation monitoring and SEO into an effective online reputation management solution let me know if you'd like to learn more okay so obviously very wordy and so it's very obvious to go from Like A to B and like how he's going to shorten it but let's see how he does hey Josh notice the negative review for Mario's on page one which typically drives uh 22% of prospects away restaurants and bokeh are using a lesser known approach to permanently remove negative online content no upfront costs only pay for results worth exploring okay awesome so one we went from all of this like these lines up here to basically be like look I already know that you have this problem because you have a negative review on page one and then showing me the data of why this matters and so then social proof of restaurants already using this in bokeh and then the really interesting part no upfront costs only pay for results worth exploring so now they did the homework of why you need this not explaining like oh okay like you know it's your business card and you need to be thinking about this stuff it's like no this is already affecting you and I know it's already affecting you here's the information of how it's already affecting you when we work with our clients we I call this problem sniffing um Jordan Crawford came up that name and I guess we use it together and so problem sniffing is when you use data to try to reach out to a prospect um and so then you could say like hey I think you might have this problem um and that's why I'm reaching out to you today and so this is what we have here we have ways to do this automatically so if I were to do this negative review thing um automatically what I would do is I would scrape Yelp and I would uh so you can do this in clay but you can use the Yelp integration to find reviews on a business and then you can um sort them by the lowest like the lowest rating to the highest rating so the first one you would get is somebody being like I hate this business and then for whatever reason and then we can AI generate this line on top here so that we'd be able to run this play completely automatically and then this we can run automatically as well where just say restaurants in and then location this is interesting because he lives in boa Ron and so we could also use AI to normalize the location into what people say so this is a very Florida thing um I lived in Miami for a year nobody calls it bokeh rone they all call it bokeh because there's no other boa and so it just makes sense so this is really interesting how we'd still be able to AI generate this email completely even though it looked so freaking hot with that first line right there um so yeah I mean again I again the point of this video is to really bring light to Josh Bron's content in a lot of ways I agree not many things to disagree with here everyone should check them out all right features versus benefits um okay let's move on not a whole lot of examples there less hype more poking don't say this lose 50 pounds in two weeks build a million portfolio in 60 days increase signups by 10x say this are you open to a different perspective for losing weight without dieting how are you protecting your portfolio against Market downturns have you considered using INF influencers on Tik Tok to reach young and new customers okay so I actually have a lot to say about this too sometimes this doesn't happen often but sometimes people have an offer That's too great and I've seen their case studies and there are legitimate customers who genuinely got the result that they are looking for but it does not sound believable in the cold email which is is crazy to think about and so sometime like one time we had a customer who said like they were doing tax benefits like so basically they would work with people and if they were making a million dollars a year they would be able to save them on their taxes the last person they worked with legitimately I saw the paperwork legitimately saved $112,000 on their taxes because of this new rework of the the tax plan but we can't email CEOs and say oh the last person we worked was saved $112,000 because that doesn't sound believable at all and so I so so so agree with this less hype more poking idea because sometimes like you got to remember from a cold email everybody like there's so many people who have lied to them in the past and so when it's too good then they're going to think okay this isn't true at all and so then like maybe you could save that for your follow-ups and even say that it's crazy but in your first email putting these poking questions in again super super agree with this uh killer copyrighting all right I mean let's look at this people don't care about your Revenue they care about their revenue gravy has generated over 401 million gravy has returned over 401 million back to our clients okay yeah that's true um they they seriously don't care always write in their perspective of how you'd be able to help them they don't actually care about everything that you've done which is funny I see like lead generation agencies all the time being like Oh we've booked meetings with apple and Costco and you know open Ai and I'm like okay like why does that matter like what Revenue did you affect the like for your customer so anyway is your message crispy or generic okay imagine this scenario you're out of warranty MacBook Pro starts to crash frequently you do a Google search over 6,000 Computer Service since 2015 over 6,000 MacBook Pro oh yes okay so don't do this we reduce shipping costs do this hi John we're seeing that many e-commerce companies in the pet space are doing at least 5K per month in Revenue are overpaying for shipping by 10 to 15% one of the reasons is this worth exploring for Animal Farm either way I bought a cucumber melon shampoo for my dog and I love this smell okay so you wouldn't be able automate this because you can't lie about like actually buying a product but definitely agree here if you could segment your list into a way that it's like okay I know these people fit on multiple areas they're an e-commerce store who's in the pet space that's doing at least 5K per month now I can say all these things to these people so this is really this actually really isn't a copywriting um problem to solve this is more of a list building problem to solve so how can you stack all of the reasons of why you're reaching out to this person so are they an e-commerce store do they do support by phone do they make this much revenue are they in this space and now your list might have gone from 10,000 e-commerce stores and now all the people who qualify for this is now like 400 e-commerce stores but now you can say something super super relevant to all of them so of course again agree a lot here um this isn't cold email so we're just going to move on why loss aversion motivates prospects to respond the cigarette box message perfectly illustrates why humans hate loss it's called loss aversion the larger the potential loss the more motivated prospects will be taken to action to prevent it the lesson you start more conversations with prospects if you shine a light on what they might lose rather than what they might gain you will gain five years of your life if you quit smoking you will lose five years of your life if you don't quit smoking okay yeah this is you know again this is something you have to really think about and this is like caseby case basis and I can't even really think about anything right now um when I was selling clay.com one thing that we would do is when we called email people we would say you know instead of your instead of talking about how many more people you'd be able to reach out to we would say you know now your reps uh your reps are currently losing four hours a day on manual research we can replace all of that manual research time and so that was the um like yeah so instead of gaining their time back we were talking about like y you're losing so much time on this like replace it so I definitely agree with that here and there's kind of a cold email example killer copy that made me buy sleep the extra 15 minutes is about what I can do rather than what the product can do Sal okay great so this is all about them and what and again this goes into like selling a transformation rather than the Cause right so sleep the extra 15 minutes I have no clue what that is but I'm pretty sold at this point right and so I have no clue what it actually does but oh okay so they're doing the prep for you oh so sleep the extra 15 minutes because they're making the breakfast for you okay great like I agree too because now you're you're giving the transformation right like people they can make their own breakfast that's fine but you're telling them that could sleep extra 15 minutes of course love it sell the transformation uh all right I love this vintage por porsch at honestly now did you spend your youth dreaming about someday owning a Nissan or a Mitsubishi uh there's still only one car that feels and performs like a PCH 9 and 11 it's one sports SC great okay it's visceral makes them think honestly did you spend your youth dreaming about this example for Captivate IQ okay I like how he does this so we have a B2B example James honestly now did you spend your youth dreaming about some about someday hard pass oh hard pasting entire Excel pages into Google Sheets and then manually making judge adjustments one sheet at a time to determine payouts wow okay I really like that because so we have a customer right now who they do like automated customer support I wonder if we could send a message where we could like talk to customer support leaders and then say like honestly did you dream that when you were a kid did you dream about answering customers calls to tell them where their order is or would you want to automate that oh I really like that so yeah um now this one again it could get a little risky like when you're playing with people's not we're not playing with people's emotions here because like there's no manipulation here um but you definitely like some people might genuinely find it like uh fulfilling so of whatever job they're doing so you want to make sure that whatever is not fulfilling over here uh we take care of I really really love this example that's really great rules follow the structure okay great be crispy or specific yep all right so we got to be specific stay away from generic words like optimize streamline save time save money yep great focus on what sucks about how people are currently getting the job done not your value props Solutions have no value without a problem people can relate to I Really agree with that all right last one 25 minutes in yeah the cheat code for lowering resistance on a cold call okay great version a revolutionize your work with the best project management tool designed for all teams okay with already reading his stuff it's like too fluffy like here's another thing that I think about cold email I and I know this is Josh Brun stuff but I'm just going to insert my thing another thing we work on with our clients is like what can you say in a cold email that your competitors can't say every project management tool on the on Earth can say this like there's no project management tool that can't say this so obviously we go to version B with base camp everything's organized in one place you're on top of things progress is clear and a sense of com sets in okay A little bit of emotion uh messaging with a sense of calm you're on top of things progress is clear um so I guess the like and I I hate saying that I could improve Josh's messaging because I like and you know Josh didn't write it with this intention behind he's obviously writing this blog post and I'm sure he knows this he definitely knows this for sure I would just change this with a little bit of like you know what particular thing can base camp do like in this this one over here where he says you know did you dream about someday hard pasting Excel pages into Google Sheets and then manually doing things I totally totally agree um what we could do is like with base camp what's that thing that base camp can do that clickup can't do and then talk about it that way um but that's not the point of Josh I'm sure he would have said the same thing lower converting what the product is online photography courses for students parents enthusiasts and Pros take better picks of your kids in 15 days boom love that too transformation remember sell the transformation not the process transformation transformation transformation here are three ways to read your customer's mind podcasts where a customer is interviewed listen for the words the customer uses to describe the before story or what sucked before people gave you money oh there's more level two potential problem the reason for my call is that many VPS of sales are relying on svps or a bottom methodology to prepare a forecast or a bottom-up methodology to prepare a forecast okay true level three poke the bear my favorite I love it when he does this if you don't mind me asking how are you forecasting today poke bear question oh no this is the Poke bear question sorry is it a human derived process where reps forecast to directors directors of VPS and VPS forecast to svps or are you also using machine learning to predict more accurately what a great predict poke the bare question where it's like you know look I think you're probably doing it this way are you using machine learning to do it more accurately I really like this one case studies looking for quotes that describe the before Story by way of example here's a quote from a customer that switched to CQ determining payouts involved a lot of manual data entry great and here's how the customer quote converts into a code we often hear that determining payouts involves a lot of manual data entry great if you don't mind me asking how are you calculating running payouts today is it manual process or is it automated because a lot of people are going to be in that manual process and as soon as you say is it automated they're going to think to themselves oh wait this can be automated how can we do that finding the first spot when did you first start looking for something to solve your problem what trigger did you to think about this tell me about what you looked for to solve your problem yeah this is this is a good formula to build poke the bear questions as well because oftentimes we find those are pretty tough to build but anyway um this is just like all of these blogs that I brought up of Josh Brun really like his stuff I think everyone you to check him out this was just kind of my two cents on some of his stuff and I hope you guys learn something from reading his examples as well\#\# Date Posted:

\# Target LinkedIn Events, Posts, and Groups Cold Email Campaigns

so in this video we're going to go over some ways to find people on LinkedIn who are showing High intent for um a topic and you can scrape them turn them into email addresses and do all that kind of stuff so there's basically three really easy ways to find people who have intent for a like topic and so one you could find LinkedIn posts that have a lot of likes on them and you could Target everybody that liked those LinkedIn posts two you can find events that have a lot of and then target the people who attended those events and then three you can find LinkedIn groups and you could target the people who are members of those LinkedIn groups and so each one uh you can scrape all of them with a tool called Phantom Buster and so that's essentially what we're going to be going over today the my big warning with this this messaging is remember that these people are showing intent for the topic the influencer who has um gotten you know their attention uh they've worked hard on getting their attention they've worked hard to get the event do not run this Playbook and say oh like if you're interested in Eric nolasi you would be way more interested in me just know hey they have intent for what you're trying to sell you know if there's a huge LinkedIn post about um somebody saying you know hey I wish Excel were easier to use and then 2,000 people liked that post that is a perfect situation where you could go in and you could say hey we made Excel a lot easier to be able to use here you go I wouldn't even mention the post like they they liked the post like don't even mention the post you know that they they have the intent um but so for a situation where like I'm GNA show you this but I wouldn't I wouldn't reach out to people off of this post with this situation where I'm saying hey I've booked a a webinar with Alex arosi do you want to attend like don't don't scrape these people and be like oh it looks like you're interested in in cold Outreach strategies like I'm trying to build something here like why would you scrape that like I said the like the best ones to scrape are when people are like oh I wish this was easier and then you could say like yes we did make it easier and and like you're truly being helpful so that's my caveat like one minute caveat so the way you would do this honestly is you just go to phantombuster tocom and then let me just log in and you'll see the the Phantoms in phantombuster and they they are so easy to use you just need to know that they exist so if you want to find people who like the post see how it says LinkedIn post like or export you can use this Phantom and all you have to do is just paste your session cookie which you just got to get and then in the next step I'm not going to show my session cookie in the next step you just would hit this and you hit copy link to post and then you're going to get an export of all the people who liked this post you're going to get their name and you're going to get their LinkedIn profile then you could just take it over to Clay and just find their email addresses super super easy to get that done um same thing so with events it's the same thing so Excel let's use the same so let's use the same criteria right so so we want to look for Excel think faster talk smarter online Excel training 192 attendees great so same exact Playbook is you would come in here and instead of using this one and we're not going to save this whoops so instead of using that one we're just going to come over here and we're going to hit event LinkedIn event guests export LinkedIn event inviter so we'll do LinkedIn event guests export again you would just click on it set it up grab this URL right here put it into this Phantom and you'd be good to go now the way you scrape groups is a little bit different having sales Navigator is really really helpful and so you're actually going to use a regular search export sales na sales Navigator search export but the best part about groups is that you can use groups as a filter so I can come in here and I could say Excel Excel learning group great 270,000 people in this Excel learning group great but most of these people aren't a good fit for you so you might want to just filter it for anybody who's in the United States and this is why I use sales Navigator scraping instead of just group scraping because the group is going to get you everyone it's going to be way too annoying to do that you don't want all of that data you just want United States and you want owner right so you want an owner of a company who's in the Excel learning group great we have 768 results this is exactly what we're looking for so now we would take this search bring it over to the sales navigation search export and we would have owners who are interested in learning about Excel right off the bat from this sales Navigator search export remember that sales Navigator only gives you 25 200 results so if this result is over 25 200 you have to split the search so well that didn't even work uh let's do this so you would have to split the search so see how it's 3K now you'd have to split this so that it's like less than 2500 so you'd go to company headcount probably and like only target people that are at like 1 to 200 employees great this is 1.5k get this one scrape it with Phantom Buster um and then you would like delete these from it and then you would start at 2011 whoops 2011 501 1,000 blah blah blah blah blah great so now this one is again going to be under 2500 so then we could scrape that one and we'd be good to go uh often times like I said LinkedIn is just a great place to find leads and with one tool and a dream you can like pull all these people out use clay to find their email addresses and things like that go watch another video of how to get that done I'm not going to show it right now but uh yeah this is a great way to find people who are already showing interest for what you um sell or what you want to Target them by or or any of those things and it's public like it's not like we're making this up like we know how how they showed intent for this so uh yeah put this one to use but do good with it don't don't be annoying it\#\# Date Posted: 2024-02-29

\# End to End Cold Email Campaign Set Up

everyone in this video I'm going to go over the complete end-to-end workflow that we have in order to launch a cold email campaign you'll see all of the steps that we take to make sure that everything is all set and ready to go and uh yeah we're just going to jump into it so every cold email campaign that I start always starts with the copywriting because the copywriting always determines what personalizations and what extra things that we're going to need so this is specifically for a staffing and recruiting firm that places virtual assistants into companies this is exactly the workflow that we're going to be setting up for them and there's going to be a lot of criteria that we're going to weave in and out and like if then statements and things like that so uh here's the copy just two emails our Tam has over a million people in it so uh we're just going to keep it to two emails help with company name is the subject line I was on your LinkedIn and notice you've kept the team lean have you thought about bringing out a person to take care of repetitive tasks like and then will AI generate repetitive tasks that they shouldn't be doing anymore the reason I ask is because we help business owners offload tasks to Virtual staff so they can stay focused on a higher leverage more rewarding elements of the business would this be worth a chat email two threaded to this to add some context I figure you might have tasks like AI generated enjoyable tasks that you find rewarding and other tasks like the ones I mentioned in my previous email that are less rewarding would it be useful to Outsource some of the less rewarding tasks to virtual assistant staff refreshed of what a US employee would cost um I just want to hit home that it's a fraction so now that we have our jobs no our copywriting set usually now I go to Apollo and I'll build my list from here and so let's see here in Apollo basically we're targeting any company and we're targeting the CEO president founder or owner of companies in the United States with 1 through 20 employees this is who you're going after for this particular campaign there's over a million people in this campaign I already have 430 000 people saved so we're going to be chomping on this list for a pretty long time so what I did is I just selected a thousand people that we have emails for and I downloaded them and now we're going to build our clay table because if for most of our campaigns we're going from an Apollo search to a clay table to a Smart lead campaign and so now I'm going to show this off and so now we're going to go to our clay table and we're just gonna start a brand new oops a brand new campaign off of the data here going table okay and as soon as this opens I'm going to just clean up the columns a little bit because the columns it's going to take every column from Apollo which I don't actually want all the columns so we're just going to pause and I'm going to clean those up we have whittled this down to the only fields that we need and so the very first thing that we're going to do is I like to just go through the copywriting and just fulfill on everything that we need to say so first we need to say company name and so I'm not going to say one of these company names so I'm going to go to normalize a company name I'm just going to use clay to normalize this company name Will normalize the case so yeah it says like cost connect to there and like City Center partnership and then this is totally in caps let's see in caps total caps right we don't want that so we're just going to normalize it and we're just going to run it so while we're setting this up we're only going to run the first 10 columns just to make sure that we're always you know staying with everything now one thing that I didn't say um was actually this email is going to be dynamic which means that if uh this is if no entry job is detected and then we're going to do email one if entry job is detected first name I'm going to write this and just pause and then I'll show it to you just copy real quick and so if the job is detected what is this yeah if the job is detected notice you're hiring for a administrative assistant in the job description it looked like they would be responsible for things like and then we're going to generate what they're going to be responsible for with AI considering the job description said and then we're gonna have ai quote itself so that it looks really really clean have you considered hiring offshore um talent to complete jobs like this for a fraction what a US person would cost whoops let's catch yourself we have companies Place virtual vetted virtual assistants to take care of the assets and others would it be useful if I've helped find a person for you and that's how we're going to do the this email so I like to go stepwise and just complete all the personalizations that we need so then company name was done now we need to do like AI generated ideas so now we're kind of getting into a fork in the road where it's like either we're going to generate the AI generated ideas or we're going to generate this email and so we need to we need to get that part done and so the way that we're going to do this is first we're going to find if they have an open job if they don't have an open job they'll get this email and if they do have an open job they'll get this email so that's what we're going to do first so we're just going to come here and we're going to use the LinkedIn data find where is it find active job openings via LinkedIn and we're going to use their company LinkedIn URL and then I already have a bunch of keywords we're going to be searching for so these are a bunch of our keywords and we're going to put in our exclusion criteria and then the location is going to be the United States cool and so now we're going to see if they're hiring for these positions or not so we'll let this run and then we're going to get some conditional stuff going so company not found that's okay let's see I'll just pause for this run so we're actually getting a low hit rate on this which I can totally understand so what we're going to do is we're going to run all of them and then we're going to filter by the ones that we do find something for so that we could work with them a little bit more intensely okay so this is still running but it's taking too long to actually find things and and most of these companies actually haven't had a detective job which is totally fine we just need to um to handle it for in the future when there are detected jobs it's only a thousand it makes sense so what we're going to do is we're just going to map in a job title and say like entry uh data entry specialists and I'm going to pop over to chat GPT and make a job description great so we have uh some mock data to be using here while we wait for some real data to come through and so basically what we're going to do is now we're going to turn on the use Ai and we're going to write our prompt and so what we need to fit this into is notice you're hiring for job title clean so we need to clean the job title so you um titles that's gonna be the first thing that we're going to do and we're going to map the job title that we found here and then we're just going to save and do not run and then we're gonna do that here cool not much to clean so that's perfect so now we have the job title cleaned and now in the job description it looks like you'll be responsible for things like so sometimes I'll write the copy like this but really we're going to do this whole line in one shot so we're gonna go here we're gonna hit use AI and then we're gonna prompt so we're gonna say um sometimes people are interested so you can skip ahead but sometimes people are interested with the way that I come up with these so using the input create a sentence outlining what we drop the responsible for computer it's it's that the input is a contribution this is the point I'll just use one of these oh no no so now we're going to map the job description from the clay table Right Use the input output percentage that looks like this let's see the example it's nothing to do with the paper the job description it looks like they would be responsible for things like speaking with customers when they have issues considering the job description said um considering the job descriptions said responsible for customer our front line customer support rules of the output the output must be in the format let's get a box and should infer what uh description for what the job description outlines the responsibilities three and quoting what those quoting where we learned from the job description the inference should not use the same keywords as the quote the output under 20 words in each output with my prefix this is my prefix and now we're just going to stay in control of it and the Java description it looks like if things like cool now we're going to give it a ton of examples this is the the tough part so now well not the tough part but this is like the tedious part I guess so we're going to copy and paste the whole thing and then we're going to come in here and then we're gonna not take this job description we're gonna do this um we're gonna take one of the job descriptions we put in great you're searching for a dedicated empathetic to join our team Yeah so basically same thing so now the output we're going to take the output in the job description things like handling primer support issues considering the job Scripts as now we're going to quote it and now we're going to add one more example we'll do the same thing grab this and then add one more example and then we'll grab this and I'll read this for a little bit kind of reporting on Battle success it mentions oh wait that's the wrong one oops use social media analytics tools to track key there we go oh this is gonna be enough we're gonna let it rip we're gonna let it rip on three five first and then we'll see how this goes so the conditional formula here is we need to make sure that the job description is over 40 characters because we don't want anything garbage actually we need like really I need like 200 characters because we don't want any garbage and we're going to generate formula okay great so now we're gonna hit this we could save and run the first 10 because we don't we know what actually qualifies for this and so we'll just let it run now we have an output and so we just want to like read through and make sure that it's not stupid in the description it looks like they would respond to the maintaining act as mentioned in a job summary interesting I don't know why it said in the job summary here but everything else looks fine and I might just let that go and we'll fix it at scale later uh like if we find any jobs over here oh so here here we have like one job right so now we're gonna go here map this and so we're going to add this to job title and then we're going to add this to job description right so now we'll see what this output looks like and it looks like they were responsible for things like managing calendar schedule since it mentions maintain managers calendars we Outlook awesome okay that's exactly what we want to have happen so now we are good to go from this so what we're now going to actually do is we're going to delete all of these because these aren't real and we're going to actually get the campaign started so we're going to delete these whoops so this and this and this we're all deleting okay great so we're deleting this this is actually like ready to run so now we look at this do we need any more personalization here no so now we're gonna say I was on your linked to notice you've got to have you thought about okay now we're going to create these AI generated ideas so now we're going to have now we need to know what does this company even do so we're going to enrich the company and yeah and then we need the company description so now we have the description here and so one thing that I actually forgot that we do all the time is we find all of our emails first and I totally forgot to do this so we're gonna set this up right now so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to use the mounts and we are going to find if this is a safe to send email address so this is actually like one of the first things we should have been doing so we'll validate these emails and then once we get one valid we'll put this out and then we'll say um follow email breaks and now we're going to take this and we're gonna put in the tagma my work email oh yeah use my own employee full name oops might not do that last name company domain website company LinkedIn URL rates all right so now for the conditions we're only going to run this if Apollo email is empty so you can use the AI thing I just know that this is what it is so this is basically saying like if it's MP run so now I want the output to be the email great so now we're going to move all these over so basically this is how we don't run things unless we absolutely have an email address for them because then it would be silly if we were to actually run them great so the tagman couldn't find another one and we're just gonna run this to just make sure so we'll just hit this a couple more times and so then what I like to do is then we have both of those we'll have a merge column and then we're going to do the Apollo email first and then we'll do email second and then I call this a master email column and we'll hit save settings then we'll move this over so now what we'll do is like anything that costs money will not run unless we have this master email column so like this asked to only run unless we have an email address for them because then it would be silly if we were to actually run them great so the tagman couldn't find another one and we're just gonna run this to just make sure so we'll just hit this a couple more times and so then what I like to do is then we have both of those we'll have a merge column and then we're going to do the Apollo email first and then we'll do email second and then I call this a master email column and we'll hit save settings then we'll move this over so now what we'll do is like anything that costs money will not run unless we have this master email column so like this asked to only run this will only run if Master email column is is full so we're going to save and do not run and then this is only going to run if this has a job title which this only runs if there's massive email columns so this is fine and then same with this and then this we're only going to run if the master email column is full so then we'll do that great so now we only we have only this data if the master email column is full so now we can move on and we're going to hit use Ai and now we're going to write a prompt that I have not made a preset for and we need to need to make a preset for so now this is going to be like um crappy tasks people have to do so I'm gonna write this and I'm going to pause the video and then we'll go over it I have using input output three bullet points of boring things that this person has to do considering a job title and what the company description is the input is this create three bullet points about boring things that this person would need to do each bullet point under 50 words and we um no that's fine so now we're going to give it some examples so we'll copy and paste this we'll probably just give it one example to be completely honest and so then we'll do this and then we're gonna say their job title is CEO and then the company description is this we need to grab a company description great so now this is the company description okay the service disables veteran owned we provide recruiting solutions for RPA involved companies okay so this is a recruiting company so um this is funny this is probably like not the person we should reach out to we should probably actually make it um what we should do is only we should change the email column to only run if the industry is not Staffing and recruiting so that we don't run into this issue so we're going to solve this problem after so now we're just going to write this out though and so um uh they reports requirements all of the resumes you've collected for them it's another boring thing that a staffing recruiting company would do okay so then that would be those three things so now we're going to put this we're going to take the settings uh Jeep chappy chat GPT 3.5 can handle this sun will say like Master email well actually I don't know how to do it well yeah maybe I do but whatever Master email column who is not empty and we'll do response is empty cool so then we'll hit generate formula cool cool save and run yep we're good to go and then we'll see what these look like of course we have a lot queued here so while we're seeing what that looks like let's go here and see wow okay so the aviation and Aerospace we would have missed that anyway um so we'll do something like in the Run settings we can just put uh don't run if industry contains nothing for Staffing it says lowercase like I wouldn't wanna I don't know what Apollo is going to do cool all right and then we're going to take this and we'll just save and do not run and then we're going to take this and we're gonna do like and and this is just like the way JavaScript works I actually don't know really how it works so anyway so we'll do this the tag was not getting us anything here all right so cool then we will move over let's see what this output looks like cool manage the financial aspects Logistics which are including coordination makes a physical music releases yeah this is great so we'll say boring tasks oops and we'll hit create column over here now we have the boring tasks for the AI generated ideas now we need to create you figured you might have task like and they will do the enjoying enjoying tasks so now we need to do the enjoying tasks so we'll do use AI actually we're going to take uh yeah let's duplicate it whatever so we're just gonna duplicate it maybe we shouldn't have duplicated it but whatever I'm using the input output the rewarding things this person gets to do considering a job pedal what the company description is put a sentence that a rewarding ask this person probably started company or because they like the ask so much or they are good at the tasks I figured you might have some tasks like complete re-output in under 15 words use my prefix through complete every output this is my prefix cool whoops we might have tasks like and so now we will copy and paste this put it down here do it again cool so then we're going to say it's yellow and then we'll take the same description as before unmanned yep okay great so now we'll take this I figured you might have tasks like we might have tasks like connecting uh iron soldiers means eager to hire them I don't think we want to put a period oh yeah we don't want to put it period and since it really needs to fit really really well we're going to do one more and we'll do this and we'll hit this and then we'll go to CEO and then for the company description let's put sub label recording figured you might have tasks like I figure you might have tasks like speaking directly and create a brief with new artists and then no period so then this is only going to run Master email column and response and we'll do no this is fine okay so then we'll hit save and run cool so now we'll move this over and so now we'll get all this together oh one thing to include too geez I forgot about this is we want to make sure and description we want to make sure that the description is long enough as more than 40 characters we need to do that too okay so we'll take this output is correct statement do not run and then we'll do enjoyable tasks just because we don't if it's too short that it's just gonna it's gonna be pretty bad save and do not run okay great so then we'll look at this I figure you might have tasks like revolutionizing battery testing methods and advancing better Technologies yeah so yeah so it's completing the sentence which I didn't want it to complete the sentence might have tasks that you'd love to do like so let's keep it let's make this easier I figured you might have tasks that you love to do like who you might have tests right you want to do like pass that you love to do like so that way we can get the period and then instead of saying the to add some context that you foreign less rewarding right so then that'll all fit great so we'll hit save and run and we'll just make sure that the prefix is working correctly here but now we are ready we would have some tasks that you love to do like analyzing this one and providing Funding Solutions I think you might have solutions to to like ensuring access to excellent Catholic Education tomorrow okay so now we have these so we're going to map these as well now we're going to go once through the copywriting again and just make sure we have everything first name AI generated ideas job title greater grade okay great so now we're going to add a campaign into smart lead you know smartly.ai and we're going to add a new campaign so we'll say CB virtual assistant rooting campaign great so I already have inboxes set up for them and so we're going to go straight to sequences so help with say company name great and we'll just put first name whoops then we'll just copy and paste everything that we got here so we'll do this oh CB virtual assistant recruiting campaign no job connected so we'll put this in here keep that and then we'll we'll add a signature in later we don't need to do that and we'll add this step we will add an email step and then we'll put this in there we're gonna wait four days first name all right so this is going to be our first campaign and then now we've started another completely different campaign because the copy is too different we're just going to keep them completely separate and so now we'll do this yeah job detected help with somebody my name cool and then we'll just do first maybe I need them whoops job title in the job description okay great and then we'll go set up just the last one cool we'll do this so now all that's left is just making sure that it's all kind of reads correctly so we are going to do this one first maybe it didn't save so then here for \[Music\] great okay so now we'll hit save it next so that we have all of this and that will go to sequences why did it do that it's all about just getting the data in so first name we're going to be able to do so this is super easy let's jump over here and we're going to do smart lead and so now we'll hit add lead to campaign our smartly to refresh fields and then we'll say no job detected and then so we're going to map everything even if it's not in the campaign we're going to map all of it and a big reason for that is just to make sure that no mistakes are made with these custom field mappings so we're going to come in here and we're going to map everything that we can just in case like you know who cares we might mess something up and well we might want this data in the future so that everything that we have we're going to do so now we're not going to use company name for emails because we cleaned it so we're going to use normalize name down here right and so now allow duplicate leads across campaigns yes so for custom fields this is the most important part I tell everybody at my company don't be a hero like what you could do is you could look at this and you'd say oh job title cleaned by Ai and then you come in here they say job title means by AI but if it doesn't match the exact case here then it's not going to matter so I tell everybody everybody don't be a hero copy and paste this Pull It in here and see how much different that was so now we will now get the job title cleaned by AI and so now where would that be okay so job title cleaned that's where we're gonna put that now we're gonna put another one what else do we have so then we have response so this is like let's see you know so now this is the job detected yeah no so we're not going to call this this we're going to say about description analysis is what we're gonna say and actually we said all of this so we can delete the rest of it so it's literally just going to be job description analysis and then we'll come over here analysis and then this is that so we'll do response job titles cleaned and then response yep that's what we want to do now we have the boring task and that's going to be in the non-detected campaign so it's just AI generated ideas Miss this so we're going to say boring tasks and then we'll say whatever this one is AI generated enjoyable tasks we're going to take that put this here and then we'll take the rewarding tasks and so now we have everything mapped that we could possibly map we have the boring tasks we have enjoyable tasks we have the job title analysis over here I mean the job description analysis over here and we have the job title cleaned we have first name last name website personal LinkedIn Master email column all of this stuff so now this is going to no job detected which it doesn't matter because we're just going to map everything just in case what it does matter for is our run settings so if this is and so we're going to put no job detected so we want to make sure that everything is filled out and it's not wrong so we're going to say uh first name is not empty and email Master email column is not empty now what else do we need for this campaign to run so this is this is no job detected right yeah so no job detected we need the AI generated ideas to run for this one to be true so we're going to go to here job title cleaned boring tasks and boring tasks is not empty now what we're going to do is we're actually going to put contains the reason why we're doing that is because if somehow even with all of our checks the AI says Hey the input doesn't give me a good thing then it's not going to be good but if it's if we put contains this Dash the only reason that it ran successfully it's going to have this Dash mark so we're going to say it contains that to make sure that it's going to run successfully so we'll do this column will run great so we'll hit output is correct and then we'll run this and now we're going to duplicate this and see this is why we put everything in there to together that we don't have to remap it but what we will do is we're going to do this we'll do job detected right yeah so now we just change our conditional formula so now we will change our conditional formula to be and job pedal cleaned is not empty and response is empty oh uh yeah sure so now we'll have it run so if we have the job we'll have a job title cleaned and we'll have a response most of these aren't going to run but that's just the the way that it goes so great so for the most part they're not running but there's going to be an instance where this should run it was here before I think it was like in the 500s come on here so now did this run see if it'll run why is the job oh you know what we don't have the email address and you know what we need these to have as well that we forgot about the enjoyable tasks both of them need enjoyable tasks okay foreign so we're going to check why this didn't run I just got to check Master email column oh and in the description \[Music\] see this is this is a perfect this is a perfect example of when we don't want it to run because then this is going to be too short the enjoyable tasks and the crappy tasks if you're going to be too short because this description is so short perfect that that's exactly what we want to block this from so now we have this all set up it's not running over here but it is running for these which is perfect so now what we can do is we're just going to come in here and we'll hit save and next and then there's just some setup options that we just need to do but we'll just hit save and next and then we have the setup options oh I guess we have to go through the setup options hang on so we're going to come in here and you see and we just give it a read to just make sure that everything looks good I was on your LinkedIn have you thought about taking her I'm going to review and approve statement the fire would it be worth a chat okay great so that worked I figured you might have tests like okay so see how we have to add some context I figured you might have tasks like and then I figured you might have task like so we got to jump in here and we're going to delete this all right so then we hit save and next and we're just going to check on this campaign if we did the same thing yeah we did also we'll hit save and next and so now we're just going to read this we'll read this one now so I'm like have you thought about it full email to figurative tests so that you love to do like revolutionary battery health testing see how there's two periods here that's something else we have to take care of so then we do that save in next and we got to go to the other campaign and do the same thing next so now company name is missing here which is interesting like everybody should have a company name so I guess that just means that we need to come in here and we need to say and Company normalized company name normalized name is not empty oops sorry formula because the company name is there for sure statement do not run and then we'll just do the same thing for job detected and company name let's see normalized name it is not empty right formula is then what I like to do is uh to go to the lead list and I will just completely delete the lead from all of them because we just you know fixed some logic we don't like um read status not contacted yet but apply I delete so we just changed some logic and I just want to make sure that all the logic is still really sound so we'll hit this disabled do not run all right great so now we can now run this for everything oh whoops so now since we were working on that small basis we need to go back and make sure that everything runs because we were just working with those 10 rows and now we're going to work with all of them cool and so basically I mean I hope you enjoyed this video this is basically a walk flew a walk through of how we set up like an entire campaign end to end this is really it this is the whole thing and so I hope you enjoyed it\#\# Date Posted:

\# Part 2: Hypothesis on Message Market Fit for Outbound Email

hey everyone in this video this is going to be the part two of my installment of attempting to find message Market fit on behalf of our customers and I hope if you are trying to find message Market fit this would be helpful for you as well I'm going to start off this video with just some proof that we've just used in order to create this process and then we're going to jump into the actual process without further Ado let's hit it year to date for 2024 we have and taken on July 31st 202 before we have generated 6,220 positive responses just year-to-date for our customers and I know it doesn't add up to 6,000 to this screenshot this is just a screenshot of the sum from an analytics page that I just have for my customers and so we get tons of crazy uh good positive responses for our emails the way we personalize them the way that we do them and these are literally all screenshots of replies that we've gotten from our email campaigns literally like saying I have to say I don't respond to cold emails although I'm impressed like all these kind of things and I have all of these just in here right and so I show these because what I want to try to convey in this video is I've recently reviewed all of the customers that we've had in growth engine X and I wanted to find out is there any campaigns that were repeatable for these customers that we should be launching on a regular basis for our other customers and so I believe that we have created a new message Market fit process that is always in development I don't think we're ever going to finish our message Market fit process but this video is going to act as a part two to our message Market fit process and so um if you saw my last message Market fit process I think some of the ideas we had were a little bit too hacky and they weren't scalable for everyone and so what we're working on currently is what are the past campaigns that were very successful for everybody and what are the campaigns that everybody should just be running that they can just check off and just say okay we tried that it didn't work let's move to the next one and is there a repeatable process that goes along with this as well because whether you work with our agency or you're running outbound campaigns yourself you need a good process of campaigns that you're actually going to run for people and so I'm going to jump over to another Google doc where we have them all lined up and I'm going to explain each one but essentially what we're trying to do is have a four batch process where we have cold email campaign ideas ranging from highly scalable different lists copyrighting messaging all these different kind of things and what we're essentially trying to do is like I said build a checklist where if you go through this process whether it's with us or on your own there's a 95% chance as long as you execute it correctly that either cold email is going to work for you and you're going to find a campaign that wins or that you should be trying a different Channel which is also okay too so let's hop over to that document right now so this is a current list of ideas that we have in order to help companies find message Market fit on their outbound campaign specifically using cold email like I said this is not an exhaustive list I'm not even saying that this is the list at this point in time this is just the list that we're working with and we're finding the most success with our customers and I'm going to explain the thinking behind all of them and so if we onboard a new customer the first campaigns that we run are in this campaign batch one we run our creative ideas campaign our standard email sequence campaign and our lookalike targeting campaign and so I'm going to break down each of these campaigns I think we even have them in this swipe file for you as well too so this is our standard sequence template so for this one we'll just start in the middle right here our standard sequence template is this template right here where we're essentially saying what I love about this campaign is it's modular and it fits for everybody and we can test multiple versions of messaging and propositions without Reinventing the entire message like crazy and so in this template you'll see that I wrote a little while ago we're saying hey first name recency waterfall or relevance-based first line essentially all this is is if you're reaching out to somebody and you need to answer the question why am I reaching out to you why am I doing this now this is something John Barrow talks about all the time we're putting this uh AI generated message in this line right here now sometimes people can reach out and they can say hey I know you're doing Enterprise sales because Megan on your team has Enterprise sales in their LinkedIn profile so I I had to figure that you're doing Enterprise sales and I wanted to reach out obviously You' make that shorter but that would be something where you would have a relevant first line to be able to reach out to somebody the thing what I call something a recency waterfall sometimes when we work with customers they don't have a super publicly available relevant thing that they could be reaching out about so what we do is we have a waterfall where I've already made another video on this where we just look for high Fidelity recent data about the person or the company so we could say hey I found this about you it made me look into your company and after looking into your company I think we should connect I saw your LinkedIn post about Fitness enthusiasts I started looking at your company and I saw how you help Fitness enthusiasts breathe better and I thought we should get connected that's what essentially these two lines would look like then for the messaging to be tested one of my favorite things to say here is we'll say something like not sure if it's fit but we're helping e-commerce Brands you know increase their revenue with email marketing whatever it might be I don't know you but you put your messaging in here and you test okay th we're going to test this value proposition we're going to test that value proposition whatever it might be I have other videos on this um that you can find on my channel so I'm not going to spend too much time on this in particular but you use this opportunity here to display different ways that you can help people oftentimes every offer in the world breaks down to how how you help people save time save money or make more money so usually they break down into those things and we're testing that messaging here and then we use AI to say specifically I think it could help you and then we train AI on what your company does so when we reach out to this company we can get a really relevant line to be spit out right here this is just one of my all-time favorite campaigns to be running for people because you get to test a lot of messaging to see what's working but then also you get that really really nice relevance in your first line here and then you get the really really nice relevance uh about the offer applied to their company right here too so this is just one of the first campaigns just off the rip that we start with because it modulates so well it makes it look really relevant I I just really love this campaign I'm not a big fan of email templates but this is definitely one of my favorite ones and then for creative ideas right here this campaign was maybe one of the first AI generated campaign I ever came up with and it's still one of my favorite campaigns I know we have it in the standard sequence template in this swipe file document as an email to the standard email sequence but we'll also run it as an email one as well too and so what this uh basically does is we have some kind of first line where since this is email 3 uh we're saying let me know if we should reach out to this company this employee or this employee but we would probably Swap this for something more like the recency waterfall and what we're basically doing is we're just reintroducing the offer and we're saying basically I would in put some offer messaging testing right here as well if this were an email one we would put offer message testing right there and then we say I had three ideas about how we could specifically help the reason I love this campaign so much as its own email one I know we have it here as email 3 and that might be a little confusing but as its own email one the reason I love it so much is because sometimes when we're onboarding a customer or you're writing your own campaigns you're just trying to guesstimate what you think they're going to find valuable but if you train AI on what you actually do and then review websites that you're about to reach out to manually and you write three to four literal manual versions of how you'd be able to help them and then you run this in an email campaign it comes up with some really great ideas and value propositions that you might not have thought of and it keeps it extremely relevant to the people that you're reaching out to so again this I like letting this run because then we're not doing the guessing on the value proposition the um AI is helping us invent some of those things and it also again turns out to be extremely relevant for the companies that we're reaching out to and so now this you can do these things but I would say the only campaign that this Falls a little bit flat for is if you're reaching out to the same company over and over again if you have if you're a SAS company and you're reaching out to uh hotels we actually just did this if you're reaching out to hotels and you help them with their training it's not really like you're going to help a hotel over here different with their training than over here but what we did in that campaign is we broke down how we help with the training and then we localized it so then we said at your hotel an upsell is this this thing we can help you get more upsells towards that thing or these are the attractions we can help your you know team suggest those attractions whatever it might be you could also break it down um that way when you manually write them and it's super easy to train the AI to be able to do this inside of clay so again one of my favorite campaigns to just start with right off the bat and then we go back to lookalike targeting this is also one of my favorite campaigns to start with literally we're just using ocean. we we find one of your case studies we find lookalikes to that case study and then we literally just go tell them the exact outcome that you had with that case study explain a little bit of how it happened and show that case study that hey you're similar to that company you know we've done this before and you have a super relevant message so in here we basically have the spectrum of AI coming up with having a lot of freedom to come up with uh relevant messaging then we are reducing that freedom a little bit and we're in more in control of that as well but we still have some freedom for the AI to do it in the third line in the standard email sequence and then for the look like targeting there's no AI there's no Freedom we're literally just like this is our case study you look exactly like our case study and then we let that go as well too so now if this first batch for some reason doesn't work then we move on to the second batch and so in the second batch my hypothesis well not even my hypothesis this is just a fact when you're running cold email campaigns there's a couple levers that you can pull you can change the copywriting and you can change the messaging or you can change the way that you're pulling your list right and so often times people kind of know that they're selling to this title or that title and so maybe there's a little bit of a switch to be done that if you think that you should be selling to the Director of Finance but the CEO is really the person you should be reaching out to maybe a little bit of a switch there but for the most part you're going to keep pulling the same list the triggers that I think everybody should try that we just bake into all of our campaigns is we will run a campaign where we find people who are new in their role we'll run a campaign where people are hired ing for certain positions we'll see if there's any Tech installations on their website we'll also look for very specific keywords on their LinkedIn profile past company experience at current customers first time enroll or a custom trigger and so we don't run these for every single company but we present them and we say okay which ones do you think would be most relevant new enroll I would say is probably the one that everybody should be running and I don't think we've ever not run that campaign if we get far enough with a customer and so new enroll is just something I think everybody should be running hiring is actually one that I think is a little bit overused lately especially with how many companies uh are coming out and they're you know uh scraping job boards and things like that I think reach if you run a graphic design software and they're hiring for a graphic designer and you say hey you're hiring for a graphic designer you should use my software I don't think that is a great use of this trigger the way we're using this now is we'll see if they're hiring for a certain position and they mention certain keywords in the job description and then we'll message towards that so we we've gone away from messaging towards the title and we're more so messaging towards the job description for the very specific keywords this is one we actually ran this for clay.com where we were targeting growth marketers but we specifically pulled their LinkedIn profiles to Target any growth marketer who mentioned no code growth hacking outbound low code all these different um keywords so we could very specifically message them about our value proposition and how it related to those keywords past company experience at current customers this is just I just love this campaign it's literally you have a thousand current customers let's see if there's anybody in your ICP who used to work at one of those customers but now they don't and then they've moved on you know into the world this is just one of our favorite campaigns to run it's not that scalable actually the I would say the thing against all of these campaigns is they're not infinitely scalable but it at least rules out is the trigger the most important part here or is it the messaging and that's what we're going for here so here we're testing messaging here we're testing triggers first time enroll one of my favorites it's like hey this the first time you've ever been a chief marketing officer before how are you thinking about these things we can also run this as like a second or a third time enroll hey you've you know this is your third time around being a chief marketing officer I know you've probably solved these pitfalls in the past but have you ever thought about this that's another trigger you could run that's not on this list or then we'll also take on a custom trigger from a customer so like not everybody can benefit from reaching out when you know employee headcount growth increases but that's another one that you could add in or company news or whatever it might be and so in campaign batch 2 we're essentially changing most of the triggers but we're still sending similar campaigns to the creative ideas the standard email SE sequence or the lookalike targeting and we're well look like targeting we would probably take out because we probably don't have a lot left from there because look like isn't infinite but we keep this messaging pretty much the same and then all the first lines changed and maybe the second lines into these triggers right so now we've done messaging testing in three different variations and then we've done trigger testing now if none of those things work the big thing that for all the people who you know might not agree with me with the way that outbound campaigns should be run I'm very biased towards using AI in all of our campaigns you should see our GPT bill um but what we want to rule out is is AI actually hurting our campaigns instead of making them better so in campaign batch 3 this is where we completely rewrite all of the messaging and we try uh different things so we have the Poke the bear campaign and the asking about priority campaign the Poke the bear campaign is very much based off of Josh Bron's teaching and his Styles and so this is basically what it would look like we basically you know have built a bot for Josh Brun style emails we write it ourselves manually as well too we'll start with a relevant first line we'll poke the bear we we say we're helping companies with a case study achieve an outcome in time without you know risk no good rotten thing or or risk right and then we'll do all of that the asking about priority this is actually the uh Patrick William Joyce classic email he's a really good copywriter and I just like the frame of this email and how nobody really sends emails like this but instead of asking directly for a meeting in this email we're also just asking is this just a priority in the company right now right and so that's just what I like about this campaign so no AI in these campaigns we're just running completely static text campaigns but we're we're just making very very simple messaging I'm going to skip over here to the extremely short messaging extremely short messaging we're just sending one or two emails with value Pro one or two sentences in the email really really short to the point we've seen extremely short messaging outperform AI based emails we've seen AI based emails outperform extremely short messaging it goes back and forth and so here then we'll switch to a one sentence or a two- sentence email campaign and just cut straight through the noise so then from a copywriting perspective we're trying to talk more about their current pains we're asking about priority and then we're also keeping things extremely short and easy to respond to and then another campaign that we'll try is a weekend campaign to decision makers and individual contributors and the reason I like this campaign is it's another just pattern interrupt of just getting another shot of just sending an email in a way that people don't often receive emails and so what we'll do is if you're commonly reaching out to the VP of sales and that's the Target that you're going for we will go below them and we'll go above them and we'll ask again about the priority but now we can say to a AE on the team we could say Hey you know and we'll send this on a Saturday hey I reached out to your VP of sales we'll name the VP of sales because we have the data hey I reached out to your VP of sales about blank and I'm not sure if they missed my email or what it might be but do you think this is actually a priority at the company we help in this way and blah blah blah blah is this something that you guys could actually get help from so we just running like a Grassroots campaign and just trying to get gather interest on the Grassroots side then we'll also go above them and we'll go to the CEO and we'll say hey this is totally on us we sent an email to your VP of sales they didn't respond I just wanted to check with you first is this something that you'd want to improve about the sales team and I should try to continue having a conversation with insert VP of sales right and so again we're just sending this on the weekend to just kind of say like just say hey you know and check in above them I well above them and Below them and see you know is this actually a problem that we could help with in your company and then uh meme template campaigns I would say I don't really send a meme template campaign where the entire campaign is a meme but I do have one or two memes that are kind of our go-to that we'll send in follow-up emails that I really like and I'm not saying that we run this as its own campaign but I like to insert these kind of things um for like email 2 or email 3 uh for clay.com we just helped them book a meeting with Salesforce and it came from the meme uh that we put in the campaign so this just kind of gets included in this batch when we're trying like I said think about the levers that you can pull you've got your list that you're sending to and what you're saying over here we're heavily focused on just the best things that we could possibly say to them that have worked for most of our customers in the past as these are are these two are our winning campaigns actually these three are our winning campaigns for our customers um in the past and then we change the the list and okay maybe is it a trigger that's going to get their attention is that the most important part we absolutely let customers give us a custom trigger but we also let them take their pick they usually don't run all of these from right here and then in campaign batch 3 wipe away all the triggers wipe away all the copyrighting start completely fresh with some new and different ideas then if this still doesn't work we get into campaign batch four where we do much more unscalable things or things that don't totally equate to somebody becoming a lead but hopefully they can help us learn about the market so unscalable things that we like to do is to Target LinkedIn engagement or followers and say okay you know this person it follows this company for whatever reason you know we think that they're interested in some way I usually don't include that we say hey I saw that you're following this company blah BL blah but we're just using them as like a a way to just build lists uh right there another good one that you can do here too is LinkedIn group scraping we can add that one into the reason I don't do these further up in our sequence is because they're they're kind of unscalable and they're pretty expensive to run these LinkedIn group scraping is really easy but these are pretty expensive to run and it's not that scalable but at this point we need to be trying as many things as we possibly can to get people's attention and then the cender similarity campaign this is just another kind of hacky campaign where it's like if you went to Cornell if you the sender went to Cornell you we can score everybody in your ICP for other people who went to Cornell as well too and then we can do an alumni campaign I know it sounds a little corny don't call out the mascot or anything anything like that we've definitely seen that this campaign gets an outsized amount of positive responses just because of that kind of like social proof and you know you're together and you're you have you share something we've absolutely seen it it works I you know don't listen to the gurus that you know college doesn't work as a personalization just don't do anything with AI and just reach out to other alumni don't go crazy you know and being like oh you went to Ruckers that's crazy that we don't do it's you went to Cornell and then a head of sales at another company went to Cornell and you share that perfect we've even done cender similarity where you both used to work at the past company uh at the same past company so we'll pull every VP of sales who at some point worked at Salesforce and now they're in your ICP working at other companies that's another sender similarity we've even done like you have the same name as them and it's like I'm Nick you're Nick we talk right like that has even gotten an outsized amount of returns so I like that one too the media creation campaign we use this to essentially create a campaign um where now at this point we haven't gotten any leads right if we're at batch four we haven't gotten any leads and or we haven't gotten leads scalably and so what we need to start doing is learning about the ideal customer profile so what I like about this media creation campaign is it could possibly become a lead magnet for you and uh you know it gets a high amount of responses so what we'll do is we'll send an email where we essentially I think I have it in our swipe file actually we're essentially yeah reaching out and we're saying hey we're speaking with other leaders and well request for quote from first name speaking with other leaders leaders no call is necessary we just said two questions and then we'll just ask two questions but here this question could possibly turn into a lead magnet question intended to actually ask their opinion that could be interesting for others in your industry and then two question intended to see if they have a problem you might be able to solve so up here it's like you know how many inbound uh calls are you receiving before you think about adding an inbound rep and then question two is what's your speed to lead and if you help with speed to lead right you know how fast are you reaching out to these leads and then they'll say like three days and you could be like yo that's crazy that's actually what our company house does we're looking to share answers from you and your peers and honestly in a report we're Gathering and so here we just want to learn like how are they thinking about the problem in the market and then uh the other campaign that we have in here is just feedback campaign shout out to Jed Marley stole it from him I'm just saying like look let me preface this I'm not trying to sell anything this is what we do you know could this be useful to you and here again we're just trying to learn about the market we're not trying to reinvent the Wheel by this point if we haven't gotten leads we just need to get feedback from the market and so then in this next section we're just going to talk quickly I just have to pause the video very quick but we're just going to talk quickly about how we think about making offers case studies and all those other things so one thing that I also think about with email campaigns is how do you actually present your offer in the email campaigns because I from my estimation right now I think you can do it in three different ways so the first way that you can do it is you can just make a flat out offer right like that that's just going to work um we used to work with one company uh they bought the email system from us so it worked so well that they actually were just like yep we'll run this for ourselves now and uh what they would do is they would reach out to schools and they would say hey instead of you paying for your electronics to be taken away I'll buy them for you so we didn't exactly say that we would basically say hey if you're looking to get rid of any Electronics we want to buy them off of you um because they imp we implicitly we're saying we know that you pay somebody else to take care of them we don't need to share case studies or anything like that we just make an offer and we can just get to the point right and so I think there are some outbound campaigns where you could just make an offer and you would be completely set and so then uh I like to start all of our customers off by just making an offer and the easiest way to make an offer is I mean I call it the heroi style but I'm not even sure if he would take credit for it because I'm sure you know somebody else invented this but if you just say we help type of person accomplish outcome in time without risk that's a great way to just make an offer framework so a lot of times we'll just put in that email uh email one we'll be putting that there or we might even make the whole email copy all about the offer right and then if you can't just send somebody an email offering them something then I think the next level that you could go to is overwhelming or matching them with case studies and social proof to say Hey you know we helped this company accomplish XYZ here's exactly how we did it this was their result would you want to talk about creating some kind of outcome like that very similar to an offer obviously but I hope you understand the distinction here where it's you know hey I'll buy your laptops if you guys are getting rid of them versus you know we have a ton of experience with buying laptops I just bought them from this person over here you know it's a super easy process we can do it all for you right and then by my estimation again after that I think you could be sending insights and Lead magnets and so I think not so a lead magnet I mean this is how I even started this business the first way I was getting my customers when I started this business is I would build a list of sales leaders in LinkedIn sales Navigator and then I would turn on the tab for posted in the last 90 days and I would scrape all of the sales leaders that I had in sales Navigator and then I would email them and I say hey I saw your post on LinkedIn recently I took all of the people who liked and commented on your last 10 posts I enriched them for their email addresses their title their company headcount their industry you know all these things and I put it in a Google doc here I'm just getting started in uh B2B growth hacking and I wanted to provide value to you just click the link and request access that I know that you got it that was essentially the email that we were sending and we would get tons and tons of responses that I could easily turn into meetings for that so we would give them the list and then we would say okay what are you going to do with the list how do you think about outbound and then we would book a meeting with them so that's how it's using a lead magnet right but sometimes people don't have it's like SAS companies and there's a bunch of other types of companies that they don't have something that they can tangibly give for free that's going to be valuable and so I help or I try to help people remember that basically every business is based off of knowledge or time Arbitrage and so either you know something about how to do a process or reach some result or whatever it might be you know something about that or you've spent time investing in a process to make it easier so I know how to build clay tables but I also have built a process where we can send 1.5 million cold emails a month right like that is uh you the two sides of the the frame in the Insight so if you don't have a lead magnet to be able to give somebody you for sure know something about the market or have spent a lot of time building something that's useful to the market and you can share that and see if it could get people interested in your email so instead of saying in instead of you know having zero lead magnet you can just say hey you know we recruit in order to interview people for our recruiting agency we speak to 2,000 candidates here's a checklist of all the things that we're looking for right just to get some kind of interest and engage engagement from them on on the other side and then feedback is the final thing and I almost put it like all the way down here because we really want to stay focused on these feedback is just when nothing's working you should just you could use cold email as a place to just learn about the market and pull insights from it from there and so I say all these things because I think that these are again you have your levers that you can pull on in a campaign the list that you can send to or the copyrighting that you're sending them you know greatly and so when we're thinking about trying to find message Market fit for customers or when you're trying to find message Market fit for yourself we want to you know we start with these because I just like the way that AI modulates these emails and makes them relevant for every person we're reaching out to and then we move to the triggers we change up the copywriting and then we do unscalable but really like growth hacky kind of things down here right but inside of all these campaigns you also want to be thinking about making a direct offer relating case studies I mean that's what the look likes campaign is entirely for relating case studies showing a ton of social proof we have one campaign where literally all we do is just inundate them with social proof I'm not sure if it's on this doc no it's not on the stock but what we'll do is we will literally just tell people uh you know hey we've you know this is how we help people I'm going to put 10 case studies Below in my signature and let me know if it's worth reaching out and then we just inundate them with case studies and social proof right and so then of course lead magnets and insights is just another way to get their attention and get some engagement in all those things as well too and so I definitely recommend that you should start with making that direct offer and then move down this scale as you so need uh because there's some markets that you can't make a direct offer and I think it's worth talking a little bit about you know is your offer a offer where you're trying to generate demand or you're trying to capture demand and so I get this really from the client Ascension guys but I think it's a really important thing to to talk about when you're generating demand you know I can just walk up to somebody I can just cold email somebody and just say hey do you want a list of all of your past uh all the people who liked your last 10 LinkedIn posts do you want a list of all those people with their email addresses you weren't waking up this morning and saying hey you know this would be great to have but if somebody presented it to you they would say yes and that's generating Demand right and so on the flip side if you know are a cyber security company or an accounting company or a website design Builder you're very much on the demand uh capture where most of the positive responses you're going to be getting are because the people are already in market and you essentially just found them randomly and then you're going to hit them at the right time and so you need to weigh out which side of it you're on and if you're on the demand capture side you probably need to think about one how can you be doing lead magnets and all the social proof and those kinds of things a lot better but I even know website agency that I mean they do great with their outbound campaigns but they're still sending very very high volume campaigns and uh they've you know one of their case studies is Google right and so um you just really need to weigh you know what is a realistic outcome for you on all these campaigns and then the final thing is is to know when to move on from these campaigns so we like to test each of these campaigns with batches of 1,000 cont s because on average across all of our customers last year we needed to reach out to 300 contacts in order to get a positive response and so if you reach out to a thousand people and you get no responses you know that you need to shift the direction of the campaign 100% right and so um I like to test in those batches of 1,000 and then we see where are you in that ratio of 1 to 300 contacts in order to get a positive response right and so then if you're below 1 in 300 that's a campaign you should scale like hit the moon go crazy send as many emails as you can without having to reuse your list in three months right that's the general framework that we'll think about but if you don't beat that one in 300 keep trying things and mixing things up but if you tried a ton of things and now at this point you just need meetings you did launch a campaign where you were getting for every 500 people you reached out to you were getting a positive response I would go back to that one and redo your math and say okay if I need to get three leads a day I need to send, 1500 emails I need to send to, 1500 net new contacts per day how many emails do I have to send do I have the runway that when I have to reuse this list it's three months down the line and this is also considering that you're sending three emails in a sequence and things like that and so I'm going to call this video message Market fit part two because I've already tried to hypothesis about hypothesize about this in the past I think there were definitely things that I was wrong about and I hope that this is a much more direct path to message Market fit and people enjoy this video and the way that I've been thinking about it I do not claim that this is the answer by any means we are all of course on a journey trying to figure out what works in marketing uh but this is definitely what I when I was reviewing a ton of our past customer campaigns a lot of them came down to some of these campaigns and so that's why we include them in our message Market fit process so I hope you enjoy comment if you have any questions and uh thanks for watching\#\# Date Posted: 2024-03-01

one thing that I see that's kind of a common workflow is when people want to Target social media influencers in order to promote their services or maybe you're actually selling to the influencers or there's there's something going on and so people come to me and they're like how do you build this list of of uh like Instagram influencers and Tik Tok influencers and and all these other things and so basically the easiest way to get this done is to scrape Google searches and so we have Clay open because we're going to be using their start with a Google search source in order to do this but actually let's start with just a regular Google search so if I were to type in uh real estate influencers Instagram this is not useful at all unless you want just 100 influencers then great like maybe you could scrape this list and and that'd be good for you but a lot of times people want way more than just 100 uh influencers and a lot of these blogs all have something to sell you like they're not just going to give you the information so how do we turn this Google search into something interesting so the first search operator that we need to use is the site search operator so see how we're receiving like this is home edit.com like what what are they even doing so we're going to put in site instagram.com because this is going to tell Google I only want to receive results from instagram.com I don't want any other results from any other places and then we are going to say real estate agent right so we let it rip and now we look at these search results okay Michaela the NJ realer excellent and here we go nice this is good and so now these are all real estate agents that we can reach out to that is a crazy thumbnail I know on my YouTube channel for at this point I don't have thumbnails and for a long time I haven't had thumbnails but that's just wild sorry let see all right great so now your next problem is you might be thinking yourself hm this is great but how do I contact these people and you're absolutely right so what we're going to search for is real estate agent and and we're going to use our Boolean search here and then we're going to use parenthesis and we're going to look for like in quotes we're going to put at gmail.com or at hotmail.com or at icloud.com or at oh whoops we need quotes at yahoo.com and so basically we'll put in a bunch of ways that people might list their email address for free on their their YouTube uh not YouTube on their Instagram page the other thing we're going to fix too is this is just real estate agent what we could do here is we could also put this in parenthesis and we could search for more things than just real estate agents so we'll look for real estate agent or realtor or real estate broker and so now the way this search reads is we're searching and we only want results from instagram.com and we can either search for a real estate agent or a realtor or a real estate broker and in their profile we must find at gmail.com hotmail.com icloud.com oh whoops forgot about that uh or at yahoo.com so now when we hit this search oh wow way bigger Vegas realer gmail.com Matt olssen gmail.com this is way better but now the next thing that you have to think about is okay this is all great but Google is only going to give you the first 300 results because that's just what Google does they only give you 300 results so the last thing we just want to put on top of this is a way to a way to split our searches so that we can keep running different searches over and over and over again so we're going to put uh like new New York City up here so now we've only got real estate agents in New York City and we have their email addresses and then the next time we run this search we'll do Los Angeles right and then we could do it again so we take this we bring it over to Clay we'll hit start with a Google search because the problem now is like you've got the Google search but like what are you going to do with all of these people you can't do anything with them so now we'll we'll uh copy and paste this we'll put it in and then we'll just run this we'll send it to a new blank table and now great now we're searching for real estate agents in Los Angeles and look what we found we have their email address here in the snippet whoa and the way we can pull that out is we can just type in extract at the top extract values from data uh they all fit a certain pattern so email addresses and then we'll hit snippet extraction type I want email addresses always validate these email addresses always always always always validate these email addresses with a tool like debounce or something like that so now we'll extract the values oh my gosh now we have their email addresses that was so easy then we'll come to start with a Google go search up here oh no we can actually hit add data whoops and then we can hit start with the Google search copy and paste this in but now we're going to do San Diego we're going to hit submit and now it's creating this search on this table where now we're adding more that are in San Diego so then we go we're at like 325 right now and see how all these people now these people are from San Diego great and so that how you set all of this up what I would also do is I would D duplicate the email addresses over here because uh see how we already have like Carlos is all over the map on this one that's just kind of the way it is and so I would just keep repeating this process and keep getting more and more uh email addresses of your Instagram influencers as you keep going now the tough part as well to get this information uh oh no one tough thing about this information is sometimes you only want influencers who have a certain level of of followers right and so a lot of times followers isn't in this uh this data here and so what you can do is you can use Cent In order to get the followers uh tell me how many followers this Instagram page has we'll put this in and we'll hit start with the Google search the link right here this is exct what we want uh the output should only be the number of followers that they have I don't need any other information now again we want this to be cheaper than a Google search inside of clay so we're going to pick 3.5 and we're going to make the Max cost one and if we don't get it we don't get it that's just kind of the the way the cookie crumbles and so now we'll go back to the top and we'll see how this does I might pause the video so we don't just wait here watching it go great and so already it's getting us the followers of these accounts and we can uh jump in here and just check Michelle Jean Kim here we go 74 exactly 4,000 1,00 2020 well 22,000 whoops let's check check that one and so then that one's right and so for let's see not even a penny we could get these people's followers and you don't have to do this manual research so yeah let me know how this goes for you this is it could be way bigger than real estate agents you could do this for you know people who post videos about Ai and VR you just change the keywords that are in there um if you want to find people who are Beauty influencers just change the keywords and so uh yeah I hope this was useful this is workflow we use all the time and people always want to Target influencers this works for Twitter this works for Tik Tok this works for Instagram this works for Facebook um just anytime that people are going to publicly put their their email address out there that's when it's going to work so hope you enjoy the video\#\#
